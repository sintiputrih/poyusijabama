Unfortunately, he left the world too soon, dying in a car crash in 2013 at the age of 40. Despite his untimely passing, however, he still has a dedicated following of fans who work to keep his memory and legacy alive. Yet, we wondered, of all his admirers was there one that was extra special to him? Did he ever end up with a significant other or wife? Here’s everything to know.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>Walker began his career as a toddler model in a Pampers commercial. Over time, he graduated to slightly more advanced roles including several TV sitcoms, and finally in 1993 he gained recognition for his role as Brandon Collins on the soap The Young and The Restless, before his break in the 2001 hit The Fast and the Furious alongside Vin Diesel. Needless to say, it was an immediate hit, turning into a franchise that’s still going strong today.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>At the height of his career, he was involved in a car accident that would prove fatal. While many mourned his death, his daughter Meadow Walker, took it especially hard, but she remains part of the Fast family after being walked down the aisle by her “Uncle Vin” at her wedding and making a cameo appearance in this year’s Fast X. So, if Walker has a daughter, who is her mother? We dove in to find out who she was, and what was her status with Walker.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-rebecca-soteros data-injectable=false>Who is Rebecca Soteros?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Meadow Walker Thornton-Allan (@meadowwalker)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=655 data-current-count=955 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebecca Soteros is Meadow Walker’s mother</a>, and the former love interest of Paul Walker. The two shared a tumultuous relationship in Soteros’ early 20s, in which Walker admitted he was less than faithful. In a tell-all interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WENN,</a> he explained where he was at that point in his life, and how he was just not ready for a serious relationship or long-term commitment. “I knew where I was at with chicks and having fun. I mean, I was sleeping with her (Rebecca’s) friends, for crying out loud. You know what I mean? I was an animal, and so I want to be there and my heart wants to be in it, but the mind just isn’t following it.”</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Soteros found out she was pregnant during the course of their rocky relationship, which reportedly led to their breakup. She moved to Hawaii with their daughter where Meadow lived until the age of 13, at which time she moved to be with her father in California.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>While Soteros and Walker were childhood sweethearts, dated as adults, and shared a child together, they never were officially married. They had also long since parted ways at the time of Walker’s untimely death.</p><p data-characters=738 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>At the time of his passing, Walker was known to be dating Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell. The relationship was wrapped in scandal, as the two began dating when he was 33 and she was only 16. How the two met is a bit of a mystery. There was a significant age difference, and Walker was already a Hollywood heavy hitter at the time. She was in high school living in Goleta, California with her parents, who owned a landscaping business. She eventually became a student at Unity College studying conservation. The couple remained together for seven years and there were rumors that they did have some plans to marry, but they were never officially engaged. They were together until the time of his death, when he was 40 years old and she was 23.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>In fact, the question of “was Paul Walker ever married?” is an easy one to answer when he never was. He dated and had a daughter with Soteros, and had several other short-lived relationships before his final one with Pilchard-Gosnell.</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>The actor may be gone, but his memory still lives on with the people who knew him best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6KcXZuutMCMmqWdZZaqv6q71KxkrKyRp3qxrdSlZLCZnKCys3nEr5yrZZ2Wv7PFjJqlnWWYlsOmecBmrqKelWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-ever-marry-and-have-a-wife.html&text=Did%20Fast%20and%20Furious%20star%20Paul%20Walker%20ever%20marry%20and%20have%20a%20wife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-ever-marry-and-have-a-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-ever-marry-and-have-a-wife.html&title=Did%20Fast%20and%20Furious%20star%20Paul%20Walker%20ever%20marry%20and%20have%20a%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-ever-marry-and-have-a-wife.html&title=Did%20Fast%20and%20Furious%20star%20Paul%20Walker%20ever%20marry%20and%20have%20a%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-ever-marry-and-have-a-wife.html&title=Did%20Fast%20and%20Furious%20star%20Paul%20Walker%20ever%20marry%20and%20have%20a%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-ever-marry-and-have-a-wife.html&description=Did%20Fast%20and%20Furious%20star%20Paul%20Walker%20ever%20marry%20and%20have%20a%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-can-i-watch-the-nickelodeon-super-bowl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How can I watch The Nickelodeon Super Bowl?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./colin-dexter-inspector-morse-author-dead.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Colin Dextor, author of Inspector Morse novels, dies">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
