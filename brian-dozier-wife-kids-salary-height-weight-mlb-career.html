After that, he kicked off his career playing in the minor league before becoming the winner of the Sherry Robertson Award of 2011 after becoming the Twins Minor League Player.</span></p><p><span>In 2012, when Justin Morneau was named to the disabled list, Dozier was promoted to the Major League to replace him.&nbsp;It was from there that he came to establish himself in the team and achieved a record 25 runs in April 2014. Interestingly, this record shattered the previous record set by the former Hall of Famer. fame of the team’s baseball, Paul Molitor, whose club record stood for a whopping 18 years.</span></p><p><span>As 2014 was a big year for him, he didn’t make the All-Star Game, he made the 2014 Home Run Derby after American League captain Jose Bautista selected him.&nbsp;In the same year, he would record 20+ home runs and 20+ stolen bases (20/20 season), which would position him as the 13th second baseman in MLB history to do the same, as well as the first in the history of the Twins.&nbsp;Additionally, he became the second baseball player in Twins history to record such a feat.</span></p><p><span>Along with many other accomplishments in MLB, BrianDozier came second in the final all-star vote to Mike Moustakas, but was able to replace Jose Bautista, and in 2017 he won the Gold Glove Award.&nbsp;In July 2018, Dozier was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers.&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, in his first game for his new team, Brian hit a home run that impressed the team and earned him a tiebreaker.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Salary</span></strong></h2><p><span>Brian Dozier has come a long way in the league.&nbsp;In 2015, he signed a deal that would see him stay with the Minnesota Twins for the next 4 years before moving to the Dodgers in 2018. According to the contract, his 2018 salary is $6 million.</span></p><p><span>In 2017, he also won $6 million while the previous year he received $3 million in salary.&nbsp;His first paycheck that made millions came in 2015 when he received $2 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>wife and children</span></strong></h2><p><span>In 2014, Brian Dozier married Renee Hrapmann Dozier.&nbsp;Both are devout Christians who, to celebrate their first year together, went to Nicaragua to help people.</span></p><p><span>Just like her husband, Renee Dozier who is the cyclist is also an athlete.&nbsp;In the mid-2000s, she reportedly played football for Southern Mississippi.&nbsp;Since we don’t know too much about Renee, we know she’s from New Orleans.</span></p><p><span>She attended Fontainebleau High School and from here she moved to the University of Southern Mississippi which, as one can easily guess, is where she met the man who would later become her husband.&nbsp;As of now, the couple still have no children.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and width</span></strong></h2><p><span>Dozier isn’t necessarily the tallest man you’d see in MLB, but he still has a decent size and an athletic build.&nbsp;He stands at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.8 m) and he has a body weight of 86 kg.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiaop6ur3nDqLGinaJixKqyxGaiopyjYsCiuMCrsGaglZ60qcCMsJyin5ipeq64wWaamqqVmr9w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrian-dozier-wife-kids-salary-height-weight-mlb-career.html&text=Brian%20Dozier%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Salary%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20MLB%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrian-dozier-wife-kids-salary-height-weight-mlb-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-dozier-wife-kids-salary-height-weight-mlb-career.html&title=Brian%20Dozier%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Salary%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20MLB%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrian-dozier-wife-kids-salary-height-weight-mlb-career.html&title=Brian%20Dozier%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Salary%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20MLB%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-dozier-wife-kids-salary-height-weight-mlb-career.html&title=Brian%20Dozier%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Salary%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20MLB%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrian-dozier-wife-kids-salary-height-weight-mlb-career.html&description=Brian%20Dozier%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Salary%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20MLB%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./interview-thomas-lennon-robert-ben-garant-hell-baby.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Exclusive Interview With Thomas Lennon And Robert Ben Garant On Hell Baby">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./13-shows-to-binge-while-you-wait-for-unforgotten-series-5.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 shows to binge while you wait for Unforgotten series 5">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
