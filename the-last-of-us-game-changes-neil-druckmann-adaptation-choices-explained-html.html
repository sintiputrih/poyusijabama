At times, the TV show offers <a href=#>nearly shot-for-shot remakes</a> of scenes that appeared in the video game a decade ago; at other times, <a href=#>it departs radically</a> from the source material. “We’d always talk about the knock-on effect: If we take this other road, what does it mean for the rest of the story?” says Druckmann. “If there was a change big enough, we’d take a step back and look at the whole season, or even past the first season. Sometimes we’d have to say, ‘Oh, that changes too much,’ and have to go back and undo it. You’re just seeing the version that succeeded.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369yeq001b3b6vrgohjz0d@published data-word-count=28>As The Last of Us <a href=#>winds down its first season</a>, Druckmann unpacked the rationale behind some of the TV show’s most interesting deviations from the original video game.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369yhd001c3b6v25ltyqtq@published data-word-count=42><strong>The </strong><a href=#><strong>series premieres</strong></a><strong> not with Joel or Ellie, but in 1968, with characters it seems unlikely we’ll ever see again. A scientist on a talk show (John Hannah) outlines a hypothetical future in which </strong><a href=#><strong>a fungus</strong></a><strong> evolves to become infectious to humans.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369yl3001d3b6vo6wf4kug@published data-word-count=50>We originally had a different idea for the opening: a David Attenborough, Planet Earth–style sequence where we’d show an ant with Cordyceps growing out of it. But it just felt a little dry. It felt like there was a more interesting way to dramatize it, and even insert some humor.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369yp8001e3b6vm8gzz7yq@published data-word-count=61>I don’t know that we needed extra information. But we wanted to make it clear that the ﻿Cordyceps have been around forever, and that people have been aware of it, and the danger of it, a long time before our story begins. Even before Joel is born. It just took a perfect storm for it to jump from insects to people.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369yru001f3b6v32xuv72v@published data-word-count=23><strong>The </strong><a href=#><strong>second episode</strong></a><strong> again opens by flashing backwards, as an Indonesian mycologist (Christine Hakim) becomes the first to realize the world is ending.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369z1m001g3b6vdex7tjdr@published data-word-count=104>With the game, we had pretty much a singular perspective: Joel and Ellie. We’re always in the United States and seeing things through these characters’ eyes. With the show, we made a conscious choice to leave their perspective. When this outbreak happened, how did it start? Where did it start? How do we make that an interesting vignette? To see an expert in her field and see the terror in her eyes. For her to say a bomb is the only chance we have. Often, in the real world, we look to experts. And when the experts panic, that’s when we get really scared.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369z67001h3b6vah2o918b@published data-word-count=35><strong>In the game, Tess is killed while fighting FEDRA soldiers, giving Joel and Ellie enough time to escape. </strong><a href=#><strong>In the show</strong></a><strong>, she’s instead surrounded by Infected, giving us an up-close-and-personal look at how Cordyceps spreads.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369z8u001i3b6vwbeasvyk@published data-word-count=42>There was a Tess backstory we almost did for the second episode. That got pretty far. She was married and had a kid, and we explored what happened with that, but ultimately it felt like we could tell the story without it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369zet001j3b6vjjxqasvk@published data-word-count=95>But it always felt appropriate to end her journey in episode two. The person Joel is closest to at that point in his life is Tess, so to have her dying wish be taking this girl was the only way to get him to continue with Ellie. The game was engineered in the same way, but because we’d already moved on from FEDRA in the previous episode, we wanted to change the second episode to explore the Infected. To demonstrate, really, what happened in those 20 years, and why so many of us died off.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369zjg001k3b6vew9u98ry@published data-word-count=102>As far as how, specifically, Tess was infected — we wanted to show these things are not inherently violent. They’re only violent if you’re fighting back or running away. If you’re just standing there calmly, all they need to do is send their mycelium into you and infect you. And we wanted it to be beautiful. We’ve tried to do that across the board. When you see an empty street, even though there’s death in the emptiness, there’s beauty in nature reclaiming her domain. The skies are clearing up because there’s no smog. It’s beauty mixed with sadness, death, fear, and panic.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369zmj001l3b6vl3jl3rce@published data-word-count=63><strong>In the show’s </strong><a href=#><strong>biggest departure from the game</strong></a><strong>, we spend </strong><a href=#><strong>an episode with Bill and Frank</strong></a><strong>, bearing witness to a love story that sustains both men through the apocalypse and up to their relatively peaceful deaths before Joel and Ellie arrive. In the game, Joel and Ellie meet Bill and discover Frank has hanged himself, leaving </strong><a href=#><strong>a bitter note for Bill to find</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369zpf001m3b6ve7cbx3th@published data-word-count=37>In the game, that sequence is about Joel learning to trust Ellie a little more. It’s also showing a counterpoint: This is what could happen if you prioritize survival over everything else. It was a cautionary tale.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369zsc001n3b6vau6ha0k6@published data-word-count=78>The biggest flaw it had, as we were trying to port it over from the game, is that it was very action-driven. And the way the show was evolving was not so action-driven. We have action sequences, but we felt like if we were just killing a bunch of Infected — which we do in the game to get you immersed and master the mechanics — it would get boring. The Infected would become less threatening, not more.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf369zuo001o3b6v8jbm6qu2@published data-word-count=108>So we started to think about the drama that would benefit this version of the story most. And we started realizing we had a lot of negative counterpoints for what Joel could experience, but we didn’t really have a positive one. There’s an opportunity here. What if it became the opposite? In our conversations, when we hit a dead end, we often say, “What if we did the complete opposite of this idea?” In this case, instead of showing a negative counterpoint, what if we say, You can win in this world. It’s actually possible to succeed, and find love, and be happy, and live a full life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a01a001p3b6v15dnt7gc@published data-word-count=77>That was our a-ha moment. The fight you see in the suicide note is very similar to the fight they have in the show: Bill believes it’s just about survival and nothing else, Frank says there’s more to life than that. In the game, Bill never bought into that argument, and the fight became bitter and resentful. Our what-if was: What if he did change? What if Frank convinced him there was a better way of living?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a03z001q3b6v628d9eis@published data-word-count=80>I started thinking about the knock-on effect. Okay, so Bill’s not alive. Well, Bill doesn’t show up anywhere else in the story, so that doesn’t matter. At the end of the episode we still end up in the same place, with Joel and Ellie in a truck driving to Tommy. But by showing you can succeed in this world, it gets you to root for them more, because there’s a chance they can come out on the other side happy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a06m001r3b6v41v98g7r@published data-word-count=39><strong>In the game, Joel and Ellie square off against numerous antagonistic factions without learning much about them. In the show, the group hunting Sam and Henry, and eventually Joel and Ellie, is given a leader in Kathleen (</strong><a href=#><strong>Melanie Lynskey</strong></a><strong>).</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a09f001s3b6vaaqwdpyt@published data-word-count=134>The game has this mechanic — what we call “environmental storytelling” in games — that we couldn’t do in the show. When you walk around spaces, you can look wherever you want, and you can spend as long as you want in them. Just by looking around you could see there was a fight and a resistance that fought back. And then you could find notes from the resistance and learn that they started with altruistic goals before becoming the thing they fought against. But we never personified that with a character, and the people you encounter in the game are just an obstacle. So we started thinking: Who would be their leader? Why would they rise up? We became very intrigued with humanizing some of these “villains” and seeing what makes them tick.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a0c6001t3b6vzn32f6ll@published data-word-count=44>Co-creator Craig Mazin had the idea to cast Melanie Lynskey. It was very intriguing, because it’s not necessarily who you’d expect, but I could see why people would follow her. She has resolve in a way that very few people do in this show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a0i0001u3b6vfv5x2364@published data-word-count=25><strong>That conflict culminates in </strong><a href=#><strong>a massive action sequence</strong></a><strong> in which The Last of Us debuts a “Bloater,” an especially dangerous Infected enemy from the games.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a0m7001v3b6viarijub2@published data-word-count=37>We were debating whether to do a Bloater — whether that would be too much. But we wanted to show that this infection doesn’t stop. It keeps evolving, keeps becoming more dangerous. We added the Bloater later.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a0ov001w3b6vemmzc65p@published data-word-count=49><strong>One memorable beat of environmental storytelling in the games comes when Joel and Ellie enter the aftermath of a once-hopeful community that collapsed, as dictated in a series of documents left behind by a man named Ish. This setting, while briefly glimpsed, is never elaborated upon in the series.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a0rg001x3b6vf5vddvy7@published data-word-count=73>I don’t know if we ever considered an episode about Ish. It’s a nice backdrop with some thematic flavor for the game, but because Ellie and Joel are not changed by that character, it didn’t feel like it was worthy of an episode on its own. You can’t do it all, so you have to pick and choose. But we have a lot of ideas for the next season for stuff like this.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a0yp001y3b6vmwdaij7h@published data-word-count=30><strong>In the first game, Joel and Ellie never actually enter the Jackson community. In the show, we get </strong><a href=#><strong>a portrait</strong></a><strong> of what a thriving community looks like in the post-apocalypse.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a1c5001z3b6vv6rn88g8@published data-word-count=39>If you look at the artbook for the first game, there’s a lot of art of Jackson. We actually wanted to go inside Jackson, but we ran out of time and money, so we go to the power plant.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a1hf00203b6voc8ge4bp@published data-word-count=111>It felt like a straight-up win for the show to go into Jackson. When we made the first game, obviously, we didn’t know where the second game was going to go, and this time we knew exactly where it was going to go. There were tracks we could lay — things for Ellie that would better establish the character she becomes in the future. Again, it establishes you could live a comfortable, healthy life in a thriving community if you just give up on this quest. Or, if you finish this quest successfully, there’s a place to return to. It was important to show it instead of just talking about it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a1k800213b6vn1gliyos@published data-word-count=22>And there are a lot of Easter eggs and callbacks to the second game. Which our fans figured out in five seconds.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a1o900223b6vfzipi1uo@published data-word-count=33><strong>In the game, Joel is injured when he falls onto a rebar, forcing Ellie to guide him out while killing numerous antagonists. In the show, Joel is stabbed by a broken baseball bat.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a1r300233b6vm79ay44n@published data-word-count=65>That is one of my favorite sequences from the first game. You’ve been playing as Joel, upgrading his skills and weapons, becoming this really capable murderer. And he falls on this rebar and gets injured so badly that we start removing mechanics. Ellie is leading the way, and yelling and panicking, and has to kill a few people to get on the horse and escape.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a21o00243b6vtm0zdhbh@published data-word-count=67>But it was one of those things where we had to be honest and say that the story we’re telling in the show is a little different. Each kill in the show has a lot of weight, more so than the game. If all of a sudden we’d done that sequence, it would have felt like too much. Tonally we’d suddenly have been on a different show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a2d100253b6v2pwxs8or@published data-word-count=27><strong>The show also </strong><a href=#><strong>spends more time</strong></a><strong> on one of the game’s more horrifying antagonists: the religious cannibal leader David and the desperation of the community he leads.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a2fm00263b6vfylfppe5@published data-word-count=57>We had fleshed out a whole intro where we saw David in the outbreak. We were interested in his reaction to the outbreak and the chaos that ensues. Where everybody else panicked, he seemed excited, almost like this was the moment he’d been waiting for. But ultimately, it felt like we wanted to stay more present tense.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a2i600273b6vtfuodbfp@published data-word-count=79>In the game, you only get David when Ellie’s around. He’s an interesting character because he puts on different masks depending on who’s in front of him. We wanted to show how he leads, and how he’s so charismatic that people follow him. All he has to do is give James a look and <a href=#>James just looks at the ground</a>. You understand their dynamic immediately. With the other kids, he can be loving and supporting or threatening and scary.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a2lb00283b6vf3apt8dp@published data-word-count=54>We also wanted you to see how beaten down this community was, and why they’ve made certain choices, because it’s so easy in this genre to have the cartoony cannibals. We wanted to show David controlling the flow of information, and that most of the people in the community don’t even know what’s happening.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a2pn00293b6v70q055tj@published data-word-count=20><strong>When Joel recovers in the show, as in the game, he brutally tortures a member of David’s flock for information.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a2s4002a3b6vkmwmzif5@published data-word-count=52>We went back and forth on the Joel torture sequence. There was a version where we didn’t have that. We were worried it would be too much, but we finally felt we weren’t demonstrating the things this guy has done and what he’s capable of enough. So we added it back in.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a2xx002b3b6vufbo52pl@published data-word-count=29><strong>The show also riffs on a memorable boss fight from the game, as Ellie turns the tables on David and kills him, enduring yet another trauma in the process.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a2zt002c3b6vqnyd4ptn@published data-word-count=75>In the game, it’s a much longer sequence, and it’s engineered to make you believe that you will play as Joel, bursting through the door and rescuing Ellie. But as in the game, it was important to show that she survives on her own, and that she’s learned so much from Joel that she doesn’t need him to rescue her physically. What she needs him for is to rescue her emotionally. To be a dad.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a330002d3b6vgunnmcgv@published data-word-count=27><strong>The </strong><a href=#><strong>season finale</strong></a><strong> opens with Ellie’s birth and the death of Ellie’s mother Anna (Ashley Johnson) — a story hinted at but never fully told until now.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a35l002e3b6vr8pjvvhd@published data-word-count=60>This story had so many permutations of how it almost came to life. We discussed doing an Anna story as a separate game, which never came to life but helped inform the sequence. There was a time I wanted to shoot it as a live-action short story and I was talking to Ashley Johnson about having her star in it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a399002f3b6vojv20bi2@published data-word-count=83>By placing the cold open here, you get to see that <a href=#>Marlene and Anna really care</a> for each other. And it was important to show that both Joel and Marlene really care for Ellie, because that’s what makes the decision really hard. Joel feels he will do whatever <a href=#>to rescue his very small tribe</a> of one other person, and Marlene is willing to sacrifice her own morality to save as many people as possible. Then we put them at odds with each other.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a3cy002g3b6v7hehs1n9@published data-word-count=43>There were times when I thought the Anna story would never come to life, and then an HBO show came along and it found its way there. Every time I think a story is dead and never coming back, it finds a way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a3gm002h3b6vy0kvqei8@published data-word-count=14><strong>In the finale, Joel reveals that he attempted suicide the day after Sarah died.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a3l5002i3b6vz8s29fkw@published data-word-count=73>There is an optional conversation in the game that players can miss. Joel and Ellie find a bathtub with the skeleton of someone who committed suicide, and there’s a short exchange where Ellie says, “Oh, looks like they took the easy way out.” What Joel doesn’t know is that she’s repeating Riley’s language. But what Joel says is, “It’s never easy,” and the implication there is that he tried and couldn’t do it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a3ni002j3b6vkid2qg0m@published data-word-count=94>So we took this exchange and fleshed it out. Craig had the idea that he’d have this scar that we could talk about very early in the season. And so these two characters are carrying these secrets. Ellie never fully talks <a href=#>about Riley</a> until the very end, and Joel never talks about the suicide attempt, or Sarah in general, until the very end. It symbolizes that all the cards are on the table. They fully trust each other and are fully being honest with each other. Until they’re not, <a href=#>at the very, very end</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf36a3t3002k3b6v3xk76itb@published data-word-count=9>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><h2>More From This Series</h2><ul class=package-list-items><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clrknyj8e00000iifuzs8uak1@published data-track-headline="Demystifying Game Design in The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered" data-track-index=0 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Demystifying Game Design in The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cldeqx0lx00000hk6dmgyxa67@published data-track-headline="The Last of Us Spawns a Second Season (of Pedro Pascal)" data-track-index=1 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>The Last of Us Spawns a Second Season (of Pedro Pascal)</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clr319pt6002c0igx0qt3mpyk@published data-track-headline="All the Winners of the Creative Arts Emmys" data-track-index=2 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>All the Winners of the Creative Arts Emmys</span></a></li></ul><a class=see-all-link href=# aria-label="See All from More From This Series"><span class=see-all-link-text>See All</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The Last of Us’s Most Interesting Game Departures Explained</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny1tMRmo5qrpGK8p3nUrGSgmZ2aeqS0wKeenqtdo7KquIydqa6bm6Kur7qMmpuaqKSWwaq7zWaaoaeZmLK0ecSxp6WZmaOypXrHraSl</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-last-of-us-game-changes-neil-druckmann-adaptation-choices-explained-html.html&text=The%20Last%20of%20Uss%20Most%20Interesting%20Game%20Departures%20Explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-last-of-us-game-changes-neil-druckmann-adaptation-choices-explained-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-last-of-us-game-changes-neil-druckmann-adaptation-choices-explained-html.html&title=The%20Last%20of%20Uss%20Most%20Interesting%20Game%20Departures%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-last-of-us-game-changes-neil-druckmann-adaptation-choices-explained-html.html&title=The%20Last%20of%20Uss%20Most%20Interesting%20Game%20Departures%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-last-of-us-game-changes-neil-druckmann-adaptation-choices-explained-html.html&title=The%20Last%20of%20Uss%20Most%20Interesting%20Game%20Departures%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-last-of-us-game-changes-neil-druckmann-adaptation-choices-explained-html.html&description=The%20Last%20of%20Uss%20Most%20Interesting%20Game%20Departures%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./was-james-harden-ever-with-nike.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Was James Harden ever with Nike?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kubota-m110.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kubota M110 Specs, Price, Reviews, Attachments 2022">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
