His parents are Arthur Elgort, a fashion photographer, and Grethe Barrett Holby, an opera director. Elgort has two siblings, a sister named Sophie and a brother named Warren.</p><p>Elgort began his acting career in the early 2010s, appearing in films such as Carrie (2013) and The Fault in Our Stars (2014). He gained wider recognition for his role as Baby in the action thriller Baby Driver (2017), for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination. Elgort has also starred in the films Divergent (2014), Insurgent (2015), and Allegiant (2016), as well as the television series The Fault in Our Stars (2014).</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Elgort is also a singer and DJ. He released his debut EP, Ansølo, in 2014. Elgort has also remixed songs by artists such as Lana Del Rey and Steve Angello.</p><p>Elgort is a talented actor and musician with a bright future ahead of him. He is sure to continue to entertain audiences for many years to come. Elgort has also been nominated for several awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Baby Driver (2017).</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-ansel-elgort-do-all-of-his-own-singing-in-west-side-story></span>Did Ansel Elgort do all of his own singing in West Side Story?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ansel Elgort did not do all of his own singing in West Side Story. He sang some of his own parts, but other parts were sung by a ghost singer. This is a common practice in film musicals, where actors may not have the vocal range or training to sing all of their own parts.</p><p>In the case of West Side Story, the ghost singer for Ansel Elgort was Robin de Jesus. De Jesus is a Broadway actor and singer who has starred in several musicals, including In the Heights and Hamilton. He was also the understudy for the role of Tony in the original Broadway production of West Side Story.</p><p>De Jesus’s vocals can be heard on several of the songs in the film, including “Something’s Coming,” “Maria,” and “Tonight.” His vocals are blended with Elgort’s vocals to create a seamless sound.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-ansel-elgort-win-any-awards-for-west-side-story></span>Did Ansel Elgort win any awards for West Side Story?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ansel Elgort was nominated for several awards for his performance in West Side Story, but he did not win any. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, and a Critics’ Choice Movie Award for Best Actor. He also won the Hollywood Critics Association Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.</p><p>Some people believe that Elgort was snubbed by the Academy Awards, as he was not nominated for an Oscar for his performance. However, it is important to note that the Academy Awards are voted on by a small group of people, and there are many factors that go into who is nominated. It is possible that Elgort’s performance was simply not seen by enough people to warrant a nomination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXqiutKeo2adnJy8s8CMnaZmmZyherCyjKGgrGWfrLtuv8innqKml2K2r3nWnqqtZaOesaZ50q2mq7FdmbalecCnqp6kXZq5qLvRrWSwoZ5irq%2FFjJqumqqUqHqnu9Fmrp6rpGLAqrDEZqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-ansel-elgort-do-all-of-his-own-singing-in-west-side-story-did-ansel-elgort-win-any-awards-for-west-side-story.html&text=Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20do%20all%20of%20his%20own%20singing%20in%20West%20Side%20Story%3f%20Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20win%20any%20awards%20for%20W&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-ansel-elgort-do-all-of-his-own-singing-in-west-side-story-did-ansel-elgort-win-any-awards-for-west-side-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-ansel-elgort-do-all-of-his-own-singing-in-west-side-story-did-ansel-elgort-win-any-awards-for-west-side-story.html&title=Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20do%20all%20of%20his%20own%20singing%20in%20West%20Side%20Story%3f%20Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20win%20any%20awards%20for%20W" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-ansel-elgort-do-all-of-his-own-singing-in-west-side-story-did-ansel-elgort-win-any-awards-for-west-side-story.html&title=Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20do%20all%20of%20his%20own%20singing%20in%20West%20Side%20Story%3f%20Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20win%20any%20awards%20for%20W" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-ansel-elgort-do-all-of-his-own-singing-in-west-side-story-did-ansel-elgort-win-any-awards-for-west-side-story.html&title=Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20do%20all%20of%20his%20own%20singing%20in%20West%20Side%20Story%3f%20Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20win%20any%20awards%20for%20W" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-ansel-elgort-do-all-of-his-own-singing-in-west-side-story-did-ansel-elgort-win-any-awards-for-west-side-story.html&description=Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20do%20all%20of%20his%20own%20singing%20in%20West%20Side%20Story%3f%20Did%20Ansel%20Elgort%20win%20any%20awards%20for%20W" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./matt-weitzman-net-worth-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matt Weitzman Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chesterfield-va-bella-rodriguez-missing-juvenile.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chesterfield VA Bella Rodriguez Missing: Juvenile Found Safe After Long">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
