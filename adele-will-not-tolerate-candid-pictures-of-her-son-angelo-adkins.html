Her debut album, 19, was released back in 2008, selling over 2.5 million copies in the UK alone and becoming one of the top 20 best-selling debut albums of all time. Since then, this British singer has sold millions of records all across the world and has topped the charts on more than one occasion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar51166522.jpg><p>Despite her successful career, Adele has managed to keep her personal life private. When it comes to her family, the Grammy winner prefers to fly under the radar. More than once, the singer has expressed she would rather not have her son, Angelo, photographed or put in the spotlight. In fact, the “Chasing Pavements” singer once filed a lawsuit against the paparazzi for taking candid pictures of the minor without her consent.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Adele Had A Troubling Relationship With Her Father, But They Finally Found Peace Before His Passing</a></span></p><h2 id=adele-maintained-her-relationship-with-simon-konecki-a-secret-for-a-long-time>Adele Maintained Her Relationship with Simon Konecki a Secret for a Long Time</h2><p>Unlike other celebrities, Adele prefers to keep her romantic life out of the spotlight. The Grammy winner first met charity executive Simon Konecki in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A year later, the couple was spotted on several dates, and by the summer of 2012, they announced that they were expecting a child together.</p><p>"[We] are expecting our first child together. We're over the moon and very excited," she wrote, asking fans to "please respect our privacy at this precious time," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the singer, then 24, had wrote on her site</a>. Later that year, a source close to the singer confirmed that Adele and Konecki had welcomed a baby boy into the world. Although the pair initially chose to keep their newborn's name private, they later revealed it to be Angelo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49954845.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the duration of their relationship, Adele and Konecki managed to keep most aspects of their romantic life private. However, the singer would sometimes address their relationship. For example, in 2016, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adele told Vanity Fair</a> that her relationship with Konecki was “the most serious relationship I've ever been in," Adele told Vanity Fair of her romance with Konecki in 2016.</p><p>In 2018, they finally tied the knot. Fans were shocked when the singer admitted to having gotten that year because she had referenced Konecki as her husband way before that. "I always called him my husband because we had a kid together," Adele then explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Did Adele’s Success Cause Her First Marriage To Fail?</a></span></p><p>A year later, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">representatives for Adele announced that she and Konecki were separating</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Adele and her partner have separated," the singer's reps, Benny Tarantini and Carl Fysh, said in a statement to the Associated Press. "They are committed to raising their son together lovingly. As always, they ask for privacy. There will be no further comment."</p><p>Adele later <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">revealed to Vogue</a> that the pair had "kept [the breakup] to ourselves for a very long time." Despite the breakup, they maintained an amicable relationship and chose to co-parent their son, Angelo, sharing joint custody and even living across the street from one another.</p><h2 id=adele-has-expressed-her-concerns-about-her-son-being-photographed-by-the-paparazzi>Adele Has Expressed Her Concerns About Her Son Being Photographed By The Paparazzi</h2><p>Just like they kept their relationship under wraps, Adele and Simon Konecki chose to keep their son, Angelo, out of the spotlight. The singer even went as far as requesting her son not to be photographed. She even voiced her concerns over this matter on several occasions. And, honestly, her reasoning makes sense.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar51140362.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I think it’s really hard being a famous person’s child. What if he wants to smoke weed or drink underage, or what if he’s gay and doesn’t want to tell me, and then he’s photographed and that’s how I find out?,” the “Rolling in the Deep” singer said, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">according to Vulture</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Is Adele's Relationship Like With Son Angelo?</a></span></p><h2 id=adele-won-a-five-figure-sum-in-damages-over-paparazzi-photos-of-her-son>Adele Won a Five-Figure Sum in Damages Over Paparazzi Photos of Her Son</h2><p>Adele has proved she won’t tolerate paparazzi taking pictures of her son, Angelo. In 2014, the singer and her then-partner, Simon Konecki, brought a privacy case against British photo agency Corbis Images UK, which published intrusive paparazzi images of their son taken during family outings a year prior.</p><p>“It is a matter of profound sadness that many of his milestone moments, such as his first family outing and his first trip to playgroup, were photographed and published worldwide expressly against his family’s wishes. Adele and Simon never encourage such photos. Quite the opposite”, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the singer’s legal team expressed</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-47.jpg><p>Ultimately, the case came to an end that same year, ruling in favor of the singer. Lawyers for Adele's two-year-old son, Angelo Adkins, accepted a five-figure sum in damages to settle this privacy case over paparazzi photos.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adele's lawyer told the BBC</a> that the money awarded to Angelo would be kept in trust, adding that his parents would "continue to do all they can to protect Angelo's rights in relation to the paparazzi, including taking legal action where necessary."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adele is not the only celebrity who has taken action to protect their children’s privacy. For example, most recently, Jennifer Garner and Halle Berry testified at a hearing to support a California bill that would keep photographers away from the children of celebrities. And <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell have asked fans to stop buying magazines</a> that publish photos of stars' children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZ2cmnq4tculZKenpGLBsLjEq5itnV2Yrq%2BwyJ1kqaGTqcKzsdJmpp9lmJq%2Fbr%2FOp2SappeaubB5wJ2ioqajZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fadele-will-not-tolerate-candid-pictures-of-her-son-angelo-adkins.html&text=Adele%20Will%20Not%20Tolerate%20Candid%20Pictures%20Of%20Her%20Son%20Angelo%20Adkins&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadele-will-not-tolerate-candid-pictures-of-her-son-angelo-adkins.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadele-will-not-tolerate-candid-pictures-of-her-son-angelo-adkins.html&title=Adele%20Will%20Not%20Tolerate%20Candid%20Pictures%20Of%20Her%20Son%20Angelo%20Adkins" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fadele-will-not-tolerate-candid-pictures-of-her-son-angelo-adkins.html&title=Adele%20Will%20Not%20Tolerate%20Candid%20Pictures%20Of%20Her%20Son%20Angelo%20Adkins" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fadele-will-not-tolerate-candid-pictures-of-her-son-angelo-adkins.html&title=Adele%20Will%20Not%20Tolerate%20Candid%20Pictures%20Of%20Her%20Son%20Angelo%20Adkins" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadele-will-not-tolerate-candid-pictures-of-her-son-angelo-adkins.html&description=Adele%20Will%20Not%20Tolerate%20Candid%20Pictures%20Of%20Her%20Son%20Angelo%20Adkins" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./aldi-version-red-lobster-biscuits-shoppers-complaint.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aldi sell a version of Red Lobsters biscuits - but shoppers have the same complaint and say don't">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./deja-skye-bio-partner-height-job-rupauls-drag-race.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is DeJa Skye?
