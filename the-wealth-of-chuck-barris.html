His reputation mainly stems from creating popular game shows such as “The Gong Show”, “The Newlywed Game”, and “The Dating Game”. Additionally, he is recognized as a songwriter, film writer, and author of several books.</p><p>If you’ve ever wondered about Chuck Barris’ wealth, it is estimated to be an impressive $120 million as of mid-2016. This significant wealth has been amassed through his successful engagement in the entertainment industry and through the sales of his books.</p><h3>Chuck Barris’ Net Worth: $120 Million</h3><p>Barris spent his childhood in Philadelphia, and details about his parents and early education are scarce. After high school, he enrolled at the Drexel Institute of Technology, from which he graduated in 1953. During his time there, he explored his passion for writing by contributing as a columnist for the student newspaper, “The Triangle”.</p><p>His television career commenced when he began working backstage for the TV music show “American Bandstand” on NBC. He later became a music producer and songwriter and achieved significant success with his song “Palisades Park”, recorded by Freddy Cannon, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, significantly boosting his net worth.</p><p>Subsequently, Barris was hired by ABC in Los Angeles to determine which game shows the network would air, and he later became the producer of his own game shows, establishing his production company, Chuck Barris Production, in 1965. His first major project was “The Dating Game”, hosted by Jim Lange, which lasted for 15 years. In the following year, he created another successful game show, “The Newlywed Game”, which aired on ABC and was hosted by Bob Eubanks, lasting for 19 years, further increasing his net worth.</p><p>Barris also created several other shows such as “Operation: Entertainment”, “Your Hit Parade”, and “The Bobby Vinton Show”, all of which further added to his wealth.</p><p>In 1976, Barris took a new turn in his career by becoming a show host with his game show “The Gong Show”, which became the hallmark of his entire career. He directed a film about the show titled “The Gong Show Movie” in 1980. Moreover, he created “The $1.98 Beauty Show”, “Three’s A Crowd”, and “Camouflage”, all of which contributed to his net worth.</p><p>As an author, Barris published his autobiography, “Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind”, in 1984, which was later adapted into a film by George Clooney. He penned its sequel, “Bad Grass Never Dies”, in 2004, and authored other books such as “You And Me, Babe” (1974), and “Who Killed Art Deco?” (2009). These literary works also contributed to the growth of his net worth.</p><p>In his personal life, Barris has been married to Mary Rudolph since 2000. His previous marriages were to Lyn Levy (1957-1976), who passed away from a drug overdose, and Robin Altman from 1980 to 1999. He currently resides in Palisades, New York.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Chuck Barris</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$120 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 3, 1929</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>June 3, 1929</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Producer, game show host, creator, writer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Drexel Institute of Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Robin Altman (m. 1980–1999), Lyn Levy (m. 1957–1976)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Della Barris</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Edith Barris, Nathaniel Barris</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Chuck+Barris&init=public</a></td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/daddydongleg?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td><a href=# rel=noopener>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0057567/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td><a href=# rel=noopener>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chuck-barris-mn0000778187</a></td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Hugo Pool, The Gong Show Movie</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Operation: Entertainment”, “Your Hit Parade”, “The Bobby Vinton Show”, “The Gong Show”, “The Newlywed Game”, “The Dating Game”, “American Bandstand”, “The $1.98 Beauty Show”, “Three’s A Crowd”, “Camouflage”</td></tr></tbody></table><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiroZ1drLKiuNOhZKieXZi1tq%2FKZpmaqqKewHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-wealth-of-chuck-barris.html&text=The%20Wealth%20of%20Chuck%20Barris&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-wealth-of-chuck-barris.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-wealth-of-chuck-barris.html&title=The%20Wealth%20of%20Chuck%20Barris" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-wealth-of-chuck-barris.html&title=The%20Wealth%20of%20Chuck%20Barris" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-wealth-of-chuck-barris.html&title=The%20Wealth%20of%20Chuck%20Barris" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-wealth-of-chuck-barris.html&description=The%20Wealth%20of%20Chuck%20Barris" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./david-villa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Villa - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Married, Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rachel-lindsay-calls-out-hannah-brown-for-deleting-southern-belle-pic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rachel Lindsay Calls Out Hannah Brown for Deleting Southern Belle Pic">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
