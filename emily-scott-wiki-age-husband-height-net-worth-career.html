Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain any information on Emily’s father. I’m also undecided about whether or not her parents are still together.</p><p>She hasn’t spoken anything about her sister or brother, either. She appears to be of white ethnicity and of Australian nationality, in my opinion.</p><h2>Emily Scott Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Emily Scott</strong> has a Koi fish tattoo on her right arm, which she received while competing in the program London Ink. Emily stands at a towering height of 5 feet 9 inches and has a slim physique (175 cm). Scott maintains her weight of roughly 60 kg by keeping a rigorous diet and working out five days a week.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>She has been working in the music industry since 2006, according to her official LinkedIn page. She is a DJ that plays on a regular basis. She went on Robbie Williams’ spring tour in the early days of her career.</p><p>She also appeared in Love Island, a dating reality show, in 2006. Aside from that, she starred in the TLC series London Ink, which aired in 2007. She even appeared on Sky One’s Cirque de Celebrité.</p><p>People began to notice her after her appearance on Australian Dancing with the Stars in 2009. Emily later joined the cast of I’m a Celebrity… in 2011. Please, get me out of here!</p><h2>Emily Scott Husband, Marriage</h2><p>After meeting through a common acquaintance, she began dating her then-boyfriend Shane Keith Warne in mid-2014. They didn’t connect on a deeper level, and in September of 2014, they decided to end their relationship.</p><p>Emily was devastated when she learned of Shane’s untimely death. She paid respect to him on her official Instagram profile by penning an emotional message for him. She also shared a photo of the two while they were dating.</p><p>Emily had previously been married to a man named Ritchie Neville. He works as a sommelier, restaurant, and vocalist in his spare time. On October 23, 2008, the former couple married, however, in 2009, they divorced. Henley-on-Thames was the location of their wedding. They split up less than four months after their wedding.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Divorced.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Boyfriend</strong></td><td>Shane Keith Warne (ex).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Relationship Status</strong></td><td>Single (Possibly).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Husband</strong></td><td>Ritchie Neville (m October 23, 2008 – div. 2009).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td><strong>Son –</strong>&nbsp;Not Known.<br><strong>Daughter –</strong>&nbsp;NA.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Emily Scott’s Net Worth</h2><ul><li>Emily has been working as a DJ, Record Producer, Model, Reality Television Star, and Social Media Personality for many years now.</li><li>As a DJ, Scott went on various tours in various parts of Europe, Australia and Asia.</li><li>She owns a massive house in Sydney, Australia.</li><li>Scott lives a very lavish life where she owns many expensive jewelry, shoes, bags, clothes, etc.</li><li>She never really talked about her income but many sources claim that Emily Scott’s Net worth is between $1 million and $5 million US Dollars as of November 2023.</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGicpqGcrnq0r86tq2avmaC2bq3GnmShraOXrq%2BwjKGcop%2BYqXqvsdNmrqiqpJ16pK3RnpyrZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2femily-scott-wiki-age-husband-height-net-worth-career.html&text=Emily%20Scott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2femily-scott-wiki-age-husband-height-net-worth-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2femily-scott-wiki-age-husband-height-net-worth-career.html&title=Emily%20Scott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2femily-scott-wiki-age-husband-height-net-worth-career.html&title=Emily%20Scott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2femily-scott-wiki-age-husband-height-net-worth-career.html&title=Emily%20Scott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2femily-scott-wiki-age-husband-height-net-worth-career.html&description=Emily%20Scott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swifts-speak-now-written-about-hayley-williams-paramore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Taylor Swift's 'Speak Now' Really Written About Hayley Williams From Paramore?
