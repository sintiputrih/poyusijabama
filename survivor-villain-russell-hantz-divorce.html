After making his first appearance in <strong>Survivor: Samoa</strong> and controlling the game, Hantz was asked to return to the show very quickly. In fact, Hantz began filming his second season before the first one even aired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his second season, Survivor: Heroes vs Villains, Hantz yet again seemed to have a lot of control. This was even more amazing since Hantz was playing with an all-star cast the second time around.</p><p>Despite how much control Hantz wielded, he lost both of those seasons. During each reunion after Hantz lost, he seemed haunted by the Sole Survivor crown alluding him and obsessed with winning the show. Based on what Hantz later said during an interview, <strong>letting Survivor change him ended his marriage</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-s-natalie-white-and-russell-hantz-during-the-reunion.jpg><p>In 2018, Hantz was interviewed by an Australian magazine called Who.
