William has co-founded several biotech companies in his career.</p><p>William graduated from the University of Southern California receiving his degree of Bachelor of Science in Business Entrepreneurship in 1994. He then attended Georgetown University Law Center between 1997 and 2000 from where he graduated with his JD degree.</p><p>According to his LinkedIn profile, William started his career with Latham & Watkins LLP as an Attorney in 2000.

Jennifer and William were together for a little over 18 years before separating in January 2021.</p><p>According to Radar, William filed for divorce from his wife Jennifer in March 2022. The court document revealed the marriage date and the date of separation of the couple, but it did not include the dating period before the wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>William requested joint physical and legal custody of the children and agreed to pay spousal support to his wife on the divorce filing. According to Radar, William did not hire any lawyers and filed the form himself, his educational background in law might have been sufficient to file for the divorce on his own.&nbsp;</p><p>He cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the separation. Jennifer filed the response three months later on June 7. The two appeared to be on the same page as she did not dispute on any claims made by her estranged beau.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Jennifer did note that the communal property was not confirmed at the moment and was still awaiting verification. Radar reports the couple owns a 5-bedroom home worth $2.4 million together which they still share.</p><h2 id=jennifer-has-five-children><span class=ez-toc-section id=jennifer-has-five-children></span> Jennifer Has Five Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennifer Pedranti children are five in number. Jennifer recently adopted her son Dominic who is 8 years old.</p><p>The names of her little ones are Dawson, Greyson, Everleigh, Dominic and an unnamed eldest child.</p><p>According to Radar, the court filing made by William revealed the names and ages of their children as Dominic who was 8 years old at the time was the youngest of the brood.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, her son Dawson was 15 years old at the time, their other child Greyson was 13, and Everleigh was 11 years old at the time of the filing. The court documents do not include anything about the reportedly 18-year-old eldest child in the family.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Jennifer’s Instagram account reads she is a mother to five adorable children, William’s court filing only listed four minor children produced from the marriage. It is unclear if she has a child from another relationship or if one of the pair’s children is already an adult.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Jennifer’s RHOC bio revealed she is a mother to five kids ranging in age from 5 to 18 years old. She has never clarified about her kids but has sometimes shared pictures with them on her social media account.</p><p>Dawson is found on Instagram with his username @dawson_pedranti where he has a little over 200 followers. Dawson is in a relationship with Hannah according to his Instagram profile, but they have not shared any images together on the social media platform.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqVlrlutM6uqp6vmauytHnOn2SoqpGjtKZ5wqisp6ypYremus2inZ6qXaWypb7Ap6uiZZ2kw6awjKilZp6ipLputMSrZKGto5eur7CMsKCtoF2nxqK6jJumspmanq6vew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html&text=Real%20Housewives%20of%20Orange%20County%20Jennifer%20Pedranti%20Moved%20on%20From%20Her%20Husband%20With%20Ryan%20Boyajian&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html&title=Real%20Housewives%20of%20Orange%20County%20Jennifer%20Pedranti%20Moved%20on%20From%20Her%20Husband%20With%20Ryan%20Boyajian" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html&title=Real%20Housewives%20of%20Orange%20County%20Jennifer%20Pedranti%20Moved%20on%20From%20Her%20Husband%20With%20Ryan%20Boyajian" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html&title=Real%20Housewives%20of%20Orange%20County%20Jennifer%20Pedranti%20Moved%20on%20From%20Her%20Husband%20With%20Ryan%20Boyajian" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html&description=Real%20Housewives%20of%20Orange%20County%20Jennifer%20Pedranti%20Moved%20on%20From%20Her%20Husband%20With%20Ryan%20Boyajian" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ron-carter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ron Carter">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./phil-robertson-net-worth-career-lifestyle-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Phil Robertson Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
