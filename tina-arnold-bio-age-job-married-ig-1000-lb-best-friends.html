They have known each other for over 25 years and now embarked on a journey to lose weight together. Learn about her age, job, her husband, and her socials in this article.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Tina.</p><h3><strong>Tina Arnold On 1000-Lb Best Friends</strong></h3><p>TLC’s ‘1000-lb Best Friends’ documents the journey of four friends Meghan Crumpler, <a href=#>Vannessa Cross</a>, <a href=#>Ashley Sutton</a>, and <a href=#>Tina Arnold</a> taking on the journey to lose some weight. Every single one of them has their reason whether it is to look good or to be alive so that family doesn’t have to endure the pain of them going away before time.</p><p>In the preview of the show, Vannessa introduces herself and her friend Meghan. Friends since senior high, they got each others’ back. Tired of all the bullying and for the sake of their children, they have shown determination to shed some weight. However, it surely isn’t going to be easy, so Vannessa also tapped their two friends Tina and Ashley to come along on the journey.</p><p>Not only Ashley and Tina are appearing on the show as their motivators, but they are also trying to lose weight.</p><p>As stressful as it is, nobody says “oversized” girls can’t have fun. We see Tina on the preview threatening to duct-tape Vanessa’s mouth in the heat of the moment. But, she is shown emotional when she talks to Meghan when she says, “My biggest fear is me leaving my kids alone without me,”</p><p>But, viewers are promised the inevitable drama which we see at the end of the preview. Based on Ashley’s <a href=#>tweet</a>, she has been a fan of TLC’s show ‘My 600lb Life’ never knowing one day she would get to star on a reality show with a similar theme.</p><p>About Tina and Meghan’s history, you should know that they have known each other when Meghan was only 15. So, they have 3 decades-old friendship behind them. Meghan wrote on her Facebook, “I have some of the best friends a person could ever hope for.&nbsp;I know you have all met Vannessa TooLarge. But this is also one of the truest best friends <a class="oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x jb3vyjys rz4wbd8a qt6c0cv9 a8nywdso i1ao9s8h esuyzwwr f1sip0of lzcic4wl gpro0wi8 q66pz984 b1v8xokw" tabindex=0 role=link href=#><span class=nc684nl6>Tina Arnold</span></a> I have on this planet. We also go way back to my age 15.”</p><p>As a testament to her long-lasting friendship, Tina also posted on her Instagram, “Most marriages don’t even last 27 years these days… but that’s just how long this chick has been dealing with my bs. I don’t say it as much as I should, ’cause I’m a hardass – but I’m super proud of her and thankful to have her in my life.”</p><h3><strong>Tina Arnold Weight Loss Journey</strong></h3><p>Tina was hinting at her weight loss journey since July 2021. She wrote, “My journey isn’t over… I’m just getting started again”. She posted a photo of herself in 2012 when she weighed 300 lbs. According to her early December 2021 post, she hated herself and it was hard for her to breathe just doing the bare minimal tasks.</p><p>A year later, Tina lost 80 lbs by working out six days a week, doing P90X with Mr. Tony Horton, and drinking two chocolate Shakeology shakes a day. For eight long months, she worked hard to learn all she could about health and nutrition, giving herself a wellness education she had never had any interest in before.</p><p>However, in 2021, Tina weighed over 300 lbs again and revealed that she was starting over again. And this time, she is doing it on national television.</p><h3><strong>Is Tina Arnold Married?</strong></h3><p>Tina Arnold has a husband. In March 2021, Tina revealed that she and her husband Johnnie Arnold have been together for 19 years.</p><p>Tina dedicated a post for her husband and wrote, “I’m grateful for this guy cause he’s been here for me for 18+ years. We’ve been through it all and he’s never faltered in his love for me. He’s here for me when I need him the most, he makes me laugh and he lets me ugly cry on him when I just need to let it all out. He’s kinda cool, I guess – in a computer geek, Star Wars loving (obsessed) kinda way… he’s a’ight.”</p><p>Tina and her husband, Johnnie tied the knots in October 2002. She celebrated her 19th wedding anniversary on 17 October 2021 with an Ig post. She wrote, “<span>Me and mah honey, out for our Anniversary dinner (a day early). 19 years (married) and counting. <a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#anniversary</a>&nbsp;<a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#dinner</a>&nbsp;<a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#marriage</a>&nbsp;<a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#almosttwodecades</a>“.</span></p><p>They are parents to four children that including at least one son and two daughters named Clara and Mary.
