Not only did Britney's father pay himself a salary of $16,000 per month, but he was also accused of <a href=#>draining Britney's net worth</a> on all manner of expenses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Britney accused her dad of orchestrating medications for her that she claimed she didn't need, more suspicion fell on Jamie Spears. It was no surprise that after the conservatorship formally ended, Britney let many of her staff go and hired new ones. Who is on Britney Spears' payroll today, and how does she feel about them?</p><h2 id=britney-39-s-conservatorship-ending-meant-people-got-fired>Britney's Conservatorship Ending Meant People Got Fired</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/britney-spears-1999-1.jpg><p>Jamie Spears likely needed many staff members to not only maintain his control over Britney but also to simply manage her household and career.</p><p>Most celebrities have private chefs, fitness professionals, housekeepers, private security, assistants, and more, but did Britney trust any of them enough to keep them around? It doesn't seem so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given Britney's claims about her father forcing her onto medication and pushing her to perform concerts, it's likely that Jamie Spears wasn't the only one giving her orders.</p><p>For example, Britney has alleged that her security detail would watch her while she showered and got dressed. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She also blasted a former assistant</a> who, based on timelines and details she gave, seemed to be Felicia Culotta, who (as of June 2023) still claims on Instagram that she's an assistant to Britney.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sam Asghari Never Needed To Marry Britney Spears For Her Money</a></span></p><p>Per Britney, Felicia made up lies about Britney's career and participated in documentaries that Spears called "trash." In one documentary, Controlling Britney Spears, which was released in 2021, Culotta stated that she no longer had Britney's phone number.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans can understand if Britney wanted a completely fresh start, and a somewhat empty home, to begin her new life in. Plus, as Britney has repeatedly told fans on social media, despite the <a href=#>criticisms of her too-perfect marriage to Sam Asghari</a>, she has her husband's full support in everything she does.</p><p>Clearly, Britney had moved on, despite what Felicia's Instagram claimed. And amid the possible mass firings comes another question: who is on Britney Spears' payroll today?</p><h2 id=who-is-britney-spears-39-current-assistant>Who Is Britney Spears' Current Assistant?</h2><p>Not much is known about Britney Spears' staff prior to her conservatorship ending, though those names are likely reflected in court filings. But since the layoffs, Britney seems to be very happy with her new assistant, whom she even posts about on Instagram.</p><p><a href=#>Her current assistant, starting in 2021, is Victoria Asher</a> AKA Vicky T. Vicky T previously performed with Cobra Starship but now releases music under her own name. She's often featured on Britney's Instagram, sometimes in risque scenarios like with Britney, who's naked, in a pool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But by all accounts, Britney loves her new assistant, who supported the #FreeBritney movement and ostensibly helped Britney restart her life after the conservatorship finally ended.</p><h2 id=who-was-britney-spears-39-manager>Who Was Britney Spears' Manager?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/depositphotos_15087289_xl.jpg><p>Before her conservatorship ended, Britney Spears' manager was Larry Rudolph, who had managed the pop star for 25 years. Given the timeline of his involvement in Britney's life and career, it makes sense if he was one of the first to be fired once Britney was free.</p><p>It turned out he didn't give Spears the chance to terminate him, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry Rudolph resigned in 2021</a> and gave a statement to the press, saying, "I was originally hired at Britney’s request to help manage and assist her with her career... I will always be incredibly proud of what we accomplished over our 25 years together. I wish Britney all the health and happiness in the world, and I'll be there for her if she ever needs me again, just as I always have been."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Jamie Lynn Spears Have A Good Relationship With Her Mother Now That Britney And Lynne Reconnected?</a></span></p><p>Plenty of fans likely scoffed at that declaration, given that Rudolph—like other staff in Britney's inner circle—had to have known what was happening to his client. Yet Larry claimed he had "never been a part of [Spears] conservatorship nor its operations."</p><p>Further, Britney's former manager said that at the time of his resignation, he had not communicated with Britney in over two and a half years. It's unclear whether, or how much, he was getting paid during that no-contact period.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-britney-spears-have-a-new-manager>Does Britney Spears Have A New Manager?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar50573636.jpg><p>The good news is that Britney Spears has a new manager, and it appears to be someone she can fully trust: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her longtime friend Cade Hudson</a>. Cade Hudson was photographed with Britney Spears as early as 2014, so the two clearly have a history.</p><p>Cade also posted on social media around the time the conservatorship concluded to explain why he never spoke out publicly beforehand.</p><p>Hudson wrote, "This is a violation of someone’s basic human rights that were taken away. I’ve kept my mouth shut out of the fear of losing my job as her agent and losing the career I worked my a** off for 15 years to build, out of threats from the man we all know who, but I won’t even dignify mentioning his name. I’m officially done being quiet."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>After Britney Spears' Memoir Is Put On Hold, Fans Wonder If It Even Exists At All</a></span></p><p>Given Hudson's statement, it seems he might have worked for one of Britney's staff in some capacity prior to becoming her manager. The two have since posted on social media together, including video clips where Britney danced in a bikini, and seem to still be great friends even while Cade works for Britney.</p><p>After so many years of staff who seem to have ignored Britney's plight, it seems she finally has the supportive team she needs—and deserves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuu81mmauhpKOyunnSqZyaqqNivaLF0aijpWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-on-britney-spears-payroll.html&text=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Thrilled%20With%20Her%20New%20Staff%20After%20Cutting%20Out%20Employees&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-on-britney-spears-payroll.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-on-britney-spears-payroll.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Thrilled%20With%20Her%20New%20Staff%20After%20Cutting%20Out%20Employees" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-on-britney-spears-payroll.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Thrilled%20With%20Her%20New%20Staff%20After%20Cutting%20Out%20Employees" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-on-britney-spears-payroll.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Thrilled%20With%20Her%20New%20Staff%20After%20Cutting%20Out%20Employees" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-on-britney-spears-payroll.html&description=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Thrilled%20With%20Her%20New%20Staff%20After%20Cutting%20Out%20Employees" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./caroline-garcia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-408381-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Caroline Garcia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-in-tanning-bed-cleaner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is in tanning bed cleaner?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
