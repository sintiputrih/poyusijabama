While the NBA is often the center of attention, there is another level of basketball that deserves recognition - Division II (D2).

Ben Wallace</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Ben Wallace, known for his defensive prowess, dominated the paint during his time at Virginia Union University.

Michael Adams</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Michael Adams played college basketball at Boston College, a Division I school, before transferring to the University of Kentucky at Pineville, a Division II program.

Jerry Sloan</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jerry Sloan, known for his toughness and defensive skills, played college basketball at the University of Evansville, a Division II school.
