Premiered at SXSW last year, Late Night With the Devil takes studio interference to the next level as evil forces threaten the broadcast of faux-’70s talk show Night Owls With Jack Delroy.

It’s telling that The Muppets and Up Late within it only lasted one season — Miss Piggy, Kermit, and company simply work better in the wholesome yet clever world of their original variety show and movies.

The Simpsons took terrified-animal entertainment to the nth degree in “Homer Badman,” giving Gentle Ben his own daytime talk show complete with a mic strapped to his head. In a darkly funny payoff, the fantasy of a bear reuniting a group of mothers and runaway daughters is crushed by the reality of Gentle Ben absolutely hating the gig and preferring to eat from craft services until the “Ben Control” team tranquilizes him.

Enter Katherine Newbury, the first host of her kind in the world of Mindy Kaling’s 2019 dramedy <a href=#>Late Night</a>. Emma “Has the Range” Thompson makes Newbury both an intimidating Iron Lady of comedy and still redeemable as she bucks critics (including Vulture in-universe), ageism, and her own biases to revitalize her nearly 30-year-old talk show. With encouragement from Kaling’s character Molly Patel, Newbury has an eleventh-hour 11:30 realization to make Tonight more personal, joking about abortion, her white savior status, and even delivering a self-deprecating yet moving monologue about cheating on her husband.

It’s a shame Martin Short dons fatphobic wear because his own physical comedy excels as he rolls his notes into a bat to figuratively and literally bash Hollywood darlings. His voice work is gold, deceptively drifting up in tone before delivering crushing insults like “I always wondered what would it be like to interview Shrek.” To Mel Brooks, he asks “The Producers, why didn’t people see it?” After Catherine O’Hara burps, he exclaims “Good lord, it’s like a fish factory just blew up!” Introducing Ice Cube, he says “Ladies and gentlemen, the wonderful Vanilla Ice.” Ill-informed as he is, Glick still makes a satisfying audience surrogate who’s never afraid to yawn in the face of A-listers’ tedious stories.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clu2qus9v006n3b7ybdrq3paq@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>19.</p></span>Zach Galifianakis</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clu2qasul001v3b7y8c4bqstt@published data-word-count=5>“Himself” in Between Two Ferns</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clu2qasvv001w3b7y9ifd8psd@published data-word-count=123>Zach Galifianakis’s deadpan bigot makes each Between Two Ferns interview painfully awkward, employing the polar opposite of ASMR with every shuffling of his papers, moist lip-smack, and jarring cough.

Speed and Tyrone take the place of Siskel and Ebert, calling bullshit on white Oscar bait and action dialogue with “crooks” until they finally agree on the merits of the zombie blaxploitation Attack of the Street Pimps.

On paper, Kenan Thompson’s long-running Saturday Night Live sketch shouldn’t work: a talk show with barely any talking and the same theme song performed over and over reads more like a one-time post–”Weekend Update” romp. Thank God Thompson’s aerobic performance elevates the premise, moving and grooving with so much joy that most guests end up enjoying their censorship.

And when those stalkers are played by Robert DeNiro (Rupert Pupkin) and Sandra Bernhard (Masha), the stakes are higher than Langford’s ratings during sweeps. Only a guy with the hosting prowess of Langford could figuratively and literally disarm his own kidnappers.

Bang!</a> from the nonexistent screen to the small screen in 2012, expanding the CBB world into The Tonight Show-meets-Pee Wee’s Playhouse mock talk show it was always meant to be. Five Seasonsman bantered with the best band leader lineup of any talk show, starting with Reggie Watts, then Kid Cudi, and finishing with the parody god “Weird Al” Yankovic himself. The most absurd CBB episodes feel like an event, such as when Time Travelman leaps quantum style into the 1960s and becomes the black-and-white host of The Sullivan Hunchy Show. Expertly blurring the line between straight man and “yes and,” Scott Pilgrimman is a solid C-plus host.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clu2reydn00an3b7ypc33kyvb@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>11.</p></span>Frasier Crane</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clu2qatvv002j3b7y06ncrwp8@published data-word-count=6>Kelsey Grammer in Frasier and others</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clu2qatxb002k3b7ysqbhjynm@published data-word-count=102>In ’90s Seattle, two names led mankind down the path to nirvana: <a href=#>Cobain and Crane</a>. Kelsey Grammer’s loquacious psychiatrist was such a hit on Cheers that he became a series regular and quibbled his way into an eponymous spin-off. Despite his extreme irritation over his family life, as host of The Dr. Frasier Crane Show, the good doctor has far more patience for his many call-ins. Unless, of course, you’re a mouthy teen who oughta be bullied. Or a kiddie crank caller pretending to be a 43-year-old. Or a total bore about naming your boat.

Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph’s physical comedy in the SNL talk show is tawp notch, from gum-smacking complaining to goading on each other’s borough accents.

Garry Shandling brought his real-world experience guest hosting The Tonight Show and being courted to replace David Letterman on The Late Show into the titular character, creating a Larry Sanders who takes his loyal staff for granted and usually acts in his self-interest to stay on top. Vying for the spontaneous talk show moment hall of fame, a segment full of spiders goes completely wrong. As Jon Stewart threatens to graduate from guest host to replacement, Sanders sticks him with guests that are a total Zsa Zsa Ga-bore. Sanders’s fulfillment of the clichéd star-studded series finale, however, is a genuinely moving love letter to the entertainment industry and cements his own place in late-night history.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clu2rqm7x00d23b7ygnv38fv9@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>6.</p></span>Ziwe</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clu2qauj2002y3b7yqwlnbrcd@published data-word-count=5>“Herself” in Ziwe and others</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clu2qauk6002z3b7ysvdc6dlu@published data-word-count=106>Ziwe is an iconic host.

Tolkein, a deep love and baritone for show tunes, and most importantly, a cutting mirror to ring-wing pundits by following their very same playbook. The Colbert Report’s greatest success is making the right victims of their own ignorance (instead of the everyday Americans they love to scam) for at least a half hour, even coining “truthiness” to describe their feelings-are-facts fallacy that persists today. Colbert didn’t always get the line between satire and softball right, as evident in war criminal Henry Kissinger’s multiple appearances on the show. At his best, however, he cut George W.

Conquering the realms of talk show, documentary, literature and even cinema since, Partridge is the epitome of jack of all trades, master of none. His influence can be heard across the tenure of The Daily Show, Ron Burgundy in Anchorman, Michael Scott in The Office, and many more echoes of egotistical pundits who value feelings over facts.
