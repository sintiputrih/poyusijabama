Can vision boards be a form of manifestation?</span></h3><p>While vision boards are often associated with the concept of manifestation, it is important to approach this idea with biblical discernment.

Are there any biblical examples of visualization?</span></h3><p>Yes, there are biblical examples of visualization. In Genesis 15:5-6, God tells Abraham to look up and visualize the stars in the sky, representing the number of descendants he would have. This visualization helped solidify God’s promise in Abraham’s mind. Additionally, throughout the Bible, individuals who were faithful to God often had a clear vision and purpose for their lives.</p><h3><span id=15_How_can_Christians_integrate_vision_boards_into_their_spiritual_journey>15.
