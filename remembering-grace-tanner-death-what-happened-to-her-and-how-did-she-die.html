On Friday, April 7, 2005, philanthropist Grace Tanner, 98, went to be with the Lord in Salt Lake City.</strong></p><p>Mrs. Tanner and her spouse bequeathed a legacy of altruism to the arts, education, and public welfare. She had a strong enthusiasm for Red Butte Gardens and the Utah Nature Conservancy.</p><p>Obert Tanner, the company’s founder, died in 1993, and Mrs. Tanner was his widow. Mrs. Tanner worked as O.C. Tanner’s secretary before.</p><p>The pair’s names are attached to The Gift of Music and the University of Utah Humanities Center. Let’s read the article to find out more about Grace Tanner’s passing and other private information.</p><h2>Recalling the Death of Grace Tanner: What Went Wrong With Her And How Did She Die?</h2><p>The greatest loss in the world of philanthropy was the passing of Obert C. Tanner, the founder and former chairman of the O.C. Grace Tanner Foundation and an emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Utah.</p><p>Through the Tanner Trust for Utah Universities, Tanner Jewelry Company established the Grace A. Tanner Center for Human Values.</p><p>The purpose of the Trust was to provide funding for a lecture series at three Utah universities where the Tanner family had strong ties: the University of Utah, where Obert Tanner taught philosophy and his father Joseph served as second president; Southern Utah University, where Obert’s beloved wife, Grace Adams Tanner, had studied.</p><p>According to Kent Murdock, president and chief executive officer of O.C. Tanner, “Grace Tanner was an exceptional woman who emanated charm and generosity in every facet of life.”</p><p>Grace’s infectious smile and wonderful sense of humor made every encounter pleasant.</p><h2>Grace’s Personal Life and Career</h2><p>In Parowan, Utah, Tanner Thomas and Luella Redd Adams welcomed their sixth child, Grace, into the world.</p><p>She married Obert Tanner in 1931 and together they raised their six children and helped run the company, which began in a cellar and grew into a multinational conglomerate.</p><p>The Tanners’ generosity played a major role in the founding of Cedar City’s outdoor Adams Shakespearean Theater, which is named for Grace’s parents.</p><p>Grace received the Person of Vision Award in 1985 from the Utah chapter of the National Society to Prevent Blindness.</p><p>Her interests in academia were oriented toward the sciences, specifically anthropology and biology, two fields in which she made substantial contributions. She passed away in 2005 at the age of 98.</p><p>The goal of the center is to provide as much exposure as possible to the ideas that best capture the essence of the human experience and the values that define it for educators, students, and the broader public.</p><p>The Tanner Center has provided visitors with the opportunity to engage with some of the world’s most brilliant minds—both male and female—who have achieved great success in their specialized fields since 1980.</p><p>The list includes the names of English lords, Nobel laureates, Pulitzer laureates, university presidents, and even past US presidents.</p><p>The Tanner Center hosts many events in addition to the annual lecture, such as the Distinguished Faculty Honor Lecture and the Grace A. Tanner Scholarship, which awards a full year’s tuition and fees to a student selected by one of the university’s schools.</p><p>The Tanner Room provides resources for both students and professors and is open Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. for study and reference material usage.</p><p>The director of the Tanner Center is Danielle Dubrasky, an associate professor of English at Southern Utah University.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1086081,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"12":0,"15":"Arial","18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/simon-sinek-motivating-speech-on-wife-relationship/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Gift of Music and the University of Utah Humanities Center</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Sam Woolf | Family And Net Worth</a></h3>Samuel Woolf The accomplishment of their son's singing must make the parents happy.
