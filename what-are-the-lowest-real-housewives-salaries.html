Here's Everything Fans Know About The Spinoff</a></span>Since there have been so many Real Housewives shows, that means lots of women have become a part of the franchise over the years. When only looking at the women who have starred in American versions of Real Housewives shows, that begs an obvious question which of the franchise’s stars have been paid the least?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-was-kelly-dodd-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-orange-county><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>How Much Was Kelly Dodd Paid For The Real Housewives Of Orange County?</span></h2><p>On May 11th of 2022, the website stylecaster.com published an article listing all of the available <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">salary information of the people who have starred in a Real Housewives shows</a>. While putting together this list, all of the salary information has been taken from that article. For example, according to stylewatcher.com, Kelly Dodd who has starred in The Real Housewives of Orange County since the 11th season is currently paid $150,000 per season.</p><h2 id=how-much-was-brandi-glanville-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>How Much Was Brandi Glanville Paid For The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of those rare Real Housewives stars who <a href=#>could be the worst in one moment and not so bad in another</a>, at one time Brandi Glanville was among the most talked-about stars of the franchise. However, since Glanville left The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills after the show’s fifth season, she was gone before the franchise’s stars were making really big money. As a result, Glanville only was paid $136,000 per season by the time she left the Real Housewives behind. In the past, Glanville has explained that she would have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made a lot more money if she returned for another season</a> but she still opted not to.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exclusive: Brandi Glanville And Jill Zarin's Advice To Anyone Going On A Girl's Trip</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-is-crystal-kung-minkoff-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Much Is Crystal Kung Minkoff Paid For The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of the time of this writing, Crystal Kung Minkoff has starred in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills since the show’s 11th season. While Minkoff certainly has been a valuable part of the show, there still is no doubt that unlike some of her costars, Minkoff wasn’t famous when she first became a Real Housewife. As a result, it makes some sense that she only gets paid $100,000 per season even though her better-known co-stars receive a lot more than that.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-teddi-mellencamp-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How Much Is Teddi Mellencamp Paid For The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ever since Teddi Mellencamp joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills during the 8th season, she has remained a part of the show. However, during that show’s 11th and 12th seasons, Mellencamp was downgraded from a part of the main cast to being a guest star. While Mellencamp may become a bigger part of the show again in the future, if that doesn’t happen she will likely never make more than what she makes now which is $100,000 per season.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-dorit-kemsley-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Much Is Dorit Kemsley Paid For The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills?</span></h2><p>Given the fact that Dorit Kemsley has starred in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills since the show’s 7th season, it seems surprising that she would appear on this list. That said, there is no denying Kemsley has never been one of the show’s most talked about stars. In all likelihood, that is the reason that stylecaster.com reports that Kemsley only gets paid $100,000 per season despite her long tenure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-was-camille-grammer-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Was Camille Grammer Paid For The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills?</span></h2><p>Yet another star from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills to appear on this list, unlike the last few people, Camille Grammer isn’t part of the show any longer. One of the show’s stars during the first two seasons, Grammer went on to be a guest star who showed up on and of until Beverly Hills’ 10th season ended. Looking back at when Grammer still starred in the show, however, it has been reported that she was paid $100,000 per season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Camille Grammer-Meyer Just Insulted 'RHOBH' And Fans Are Angry</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-was-aviva-drescher-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Was Aviva Drescher Paid For The Real Housewives Of New York City?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the 5th and 6th seasons of The Real Housewives of New York City aired, many fans have wondered <a href=#>what Aviva Drescher has been up to</a> since leaving the show behind. Fortunately for Drescher, missing out on the money that she made from starring in RHONYC hasn’t forced her to make any massive changes to her life. Part of that reason is that Drescher was already doing great financially before she became a Real Housewife. On top of that, the fact that Drescher was only paid $100,000 per season also plays a role in that.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-gina-kirschenheiter-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-orange-county><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Much Is Gina Kirschenheiter Paid For The Real Housewives Of Orange County?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Gina Kirschenheiter joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Orange County during the show’s 13th season, she likely believed that she would soon be bringing in the big bucks. While there is no doubt that Kirschenheiter is doing fine, she isn’t making that much money as a “reality” star. After all, Kirschenheiter reportedly only makes $68,450 per season.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-leah-mcsweeney-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>How Much Is Leah McSweeney Paid For The Real Housewives Of New York City?</span></h2><p>Considering that she is one of the most recent people to get the chance to star in a Real Housewives show, it seems very likely that Leah McSweeney will make more money in the future. Only a part of The Real Housewives of New York City’s cast for the last two seasons, a lot of fans hope that McSweeney will stick around. If the show’s producers want her to remain a part of the franchise they likely will have to pay her more than she reportedly makes now which is just $60,000 per season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-dolores-catania-paid-for-the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>How Much Is Dolores Catania Paid For The Real Housewives Of New Jersey?</span></h2><p>Unlike Leah McSweeney, Dolores Catania has starred in the Real Housewives of New Jersey for several seasons as of this writing. With that in mind, it seems shocking that she is one of the Real Housewives stars with the lowest salary according to the aforementioned stylecaster.com article.
