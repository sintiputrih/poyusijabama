He&nbsp;pleaded not guilty in 2019&nbsp;and was free on bond ahead of a trial that had not yet been scheduled. His lawyer, Leonard Levine, confirmed his death Thursday.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href=#>Survivor details how USC ’empowered’ campus doctor at center of sexual abuse scandal</a></p><p>A close friend went to Tyndall’s home in Los Angeles on Wednesday after he had not answered her phone calls, Levine said. She found him dead in his bed.</p><p>Levine said there is “no evidence of foul play or suicide.”</p><p>Levine said Tyndall was due back in court later this month to set a date for his trial. His client had denied any wrongdoing and wanted to present his case before a jury.</p><p>“He’s always maintained his innocence,” Levine said.</p><p>Tyndall was initially charged in 2019 with 35 felony counts, but that was later dropped to 27, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>&nbsp;reported. Eighteen were counts of sexual penetration of an unconscious person and nine were counts of sexual battery by fraud. The charges relate to 16 former patients at the campus student health center.</p><p>Allegations against Tyndall first surfaced in 2018 in an investigation by the&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, which revealed that the doctor had been the subject of complaints of sexual misconduct at USC dating back to the 1990s. He worked at the university for nearly three decades.</p><p>Tyndall was suspended from the university in 2016, when a nurse reported him to a rape crisis center. He was able to quietly resign with a large payout the next year.</p><p>Hundreds of women came forward to report their allegations to police but some of the cases fell outside the 10-year statute of limitations, while others did not rise to the level of criminal charges or lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute. Still, he faced up to 64 years in prison if convicted.</p><p>As the criminal case was pending,&nbsp;<a href=#>USC agreed to an $852 million settlement</a>&nbsp;with more than 700 women who accused the college’s longtime campus gynecologist of sexual abuse, the victims’ lawyers and USC announced in 2021. It was believed to be a record sum for a sexual abuse lawsuit against a university.</p><p>Tyndall was deposed for the settlement and largely invoked his rights against self-incrimination in answers, the plaintiff’s lawyers said. While he signed the settlement, he did not contribute any money toward it and did not admit to any wrongdoing.</p><p>Separately, USC earlier agreed to pay $215 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that applies to about 18,000 women who were patients of Tyndall. The individual payouts to those victims range from $2,500 to $250,000, and were given regardless of whether the women formally accused Tyndall of harassment or assault.</p><p>Tyndall surrendered his medical license in September 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa7SZ6arn1%2Bjsri%2Fx6isq2eelsGqu81onaiqnZq%2FbsHSnGSdp5OpvLN5wqGYq5%2BVmXq4tdOhZKydqKqurXnAm6ysnV2ks26%2F066bnqakqHqltcSsZJudlqS%2FpnnGqKCnn12pvG7A0aKYpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fformer-usc-doctor-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-students-dies-before-going-to-trial.html&text=Former%20USC%20doctor%20charged%20with%20sexual%20abuse%20of%20students%20dies%20before%20going%20to%20trial&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fformer-usc-doctor-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-students-dies-before-going-to-trial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fformer-usc-doctor-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-students-dies-before-going-to-trial.html&title=Former%20USC%20doctor%20charged%20with%20sexual%20abuse%20of%20students%20dies%20before%20going%20to%20trial" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fformer-usc-doctor-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-students-dies-before-going-to-trial.html&title=Former%20USC%20doctor%20charged%20with%20sexual%20abuse%20of%20students%20dies%20before%20going%20to%20trial" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fformer-usc-doctor-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-students-dies-before-going-to-trial.html&title=Former%20USC%20doctor%20charged%20with%20sexual%20abuse%20of%20students%20dies%20before%20going%20to%20trial" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fformer-usc-doctor-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-students-dies-before-going-to-trial.html&description=Former%20USC%20doctor%20charged%20with%20sexual%20abuse%20of%20students%20dies%20before%20going%20to%20trial" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./harini-logan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harini Logan Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./christen-harper.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christen Harper - Age, Career, Height, Net Worth, Nationality, Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
