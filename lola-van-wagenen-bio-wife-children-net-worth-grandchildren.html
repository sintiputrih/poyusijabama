She also earned a master’s degree in public history.&nbsp;After 10 years of research and academic work, she obtained a doctorate.&nbsp;in American History at New York University.</span></p><p><span>Her excellent doctoral dissertation was later turned into a book which was published in 2003. The book was titled “Sister Wives and Suffragists: Polygamy and the Politics of Woman Suffrage 1870-1896”.</span></p><p><span>Her academic career spans several decades, during which she received the Distinguished Alumni/Alumnae Achievement Award from New York University’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Career</span></strong></h2><p><span>She has served on various academic boards, including the Robertson Scholars selection committee at Duke University and the University of North Carolina.&nbsp;She served on the Appropriate Technology Task Force with the United States Office of Technology Assessment and was a member of the National Commission for the International Year of the Child.</span></p><p><span>In her professional career outside of academia, Lola Van Wagenen first rose to national fame as the wife of veteran actor Robert Redford.&nbsp;Lola’s professional career, however, was not defined by the short-lived marriage.&nbsp;She went on to serve as executive producer of several documentaries and films.</span></p><p><span>She has a business alongside Jeanne Houck, another historian called Clio Visualizing History Inc. The documentary production company has produced several documentaries and short films both for its clients and for its own internal projects.</span></p><p><span>Lola Van Wagenen is also a well-known consumer activist who started Consumer Action Now, a non-profit organization.&nbsp;Since its inception, the organization has recorded several achievements, including the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.</span></p><p><span>Other accomplishments include an honorary doctorate from the Pratt Institute.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lola Van Wagenen has two businesses that have been modestly successful.&nbsp;His documentary production company, Clio Visualizing History, Inc, has produced several short films and documentaries.&nbsp;So, in addition to the income from her college career, Lola was able to build up a net worth of $2 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>husband, children, grandchildren</span></strong></h2><p><span>Before Lola Van Wagenen began her life as an outdated historian and documentarian, she was married to Robert Redford in 1957. The marriage lasted 18 years and the two had four children namely: Amy Redford, James Redford, Shauna Redford and Scott Anthony Redford.</span></p><p><span>After their divorce in 1985, however, Lola went many years without getting married until 2002, when she married her current wife, George Burrill, an entrepreneur who runs an international development company.</span></p><p><span>Lola Van Wagenen has five grandchildren from the relationships of her two daughters, Shauna Redford, Amy Redford and her son, James Redford.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGikn6GubsLAp2SwmZeau6a6jJugqGWnnrOmecKhoKWcopq7brrErWSwp6KptW6z0ZqlnZuYnrmlvsSnZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flola-van-wagenen-bio-wife-children-net-worth-grandchildren.html&text=Lola%20Van%20Wagenen%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Grandchildren&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flola-van-wagenen-bio-wife-children-net-worth-grandchildren.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flola-van-wagenen-bio-wife-children-net-worth-grandchildren.html&title=Lola%20Van%20Wagenen%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Grandchildren" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flola-van-wagenen-bio-wife-children-net-worth-grandchildren.html&title=Lola%20Van%20Wagenen%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Grandchildren" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flola-van-wagenen-bio-wife-children-net-worth-grandchildren.html&title=Lola%20Van%20Wagenen%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Grandchildren" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flola-van-wagenen-bio-wife-children-net-worth-grandchildren.html&description=Lola%20Van%20Wagenen%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Grandchildren" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lisa-mcvey-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to Her Since She Escaped Bobby Joe Long?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hugo-chavez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-477251-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hugo Chavez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
