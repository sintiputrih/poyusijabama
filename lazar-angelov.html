Lazar’s inspiration to get fit and strong came from watching a lot of action movies. While growing up, Lazar emulated his big screen heroes. As a young not, he involved himself with basketball and weight training.&nbsp; Lazar would complete two sessions of basketball training, one in the morning and the other one in the afternoon. The weights session was always in the middle of the day.</p><p>At the time, he knew nothing about nutrition. He actually passed out a couple of times. Lazar has said that he was too tired and he didn’t recover properly. He then went to the Army for one year. After his service, Lazar got out of shape. As he was struggling with which direction he wanted to go in life, he got inspired to get serious about strength training and bodybuilding.</p><p>Since fitness was his second passion behind basketball, ILazar decided to put all his effort into it and that became his turning point. Though he has had some very tough periods in his life, he has gone through them all and is ready to overcome anything that life throws at him. To him, life is like a bench press, If one doesn’t push the weight, it will fall on him/her. This is why Lazar has to overcome each challenge life throws at him and move forward.</p><h2>Lazar Angelov Wife</h2><p>Despite his publicity, Lazar has not gone public about his love life. It is therefore not known if this&nbsp; Bulgarian bodybuilder is single, dating, engaged, or married.</p><h2>Lazar Angelov Workout | Arm Workout | Abs</h2><p><strong>Day One: Chest/Abs</strong><br>Flat Bench 4×8, Incline Bench 4×8, Decline Bench 4×8, Pullover 4×8, Hammer Press 3×8, Dips 3x failure, Weighted Sit Up 4x failure, Hanging Leg Raise- 4x failure, Side, Bends 4x failure</p><p><strong>Day Two: Back/Triceps</strong><br>Bent Over Row 4×8, Deadlift 4×8, Pulldowns 4×8, Pull-Ups 4×8, Cable Row 4×8, Shrugs 6×10</p><p><strong>Day Three: Delts/Forearms/Abs</strong><br>Military Press Behind The Neck 3×8, Machine Press 4×8, Lateral Raises 4×8, Weight Plate Front Raises 4×10, Dumbbell Front Raises 4×8, Reverse Pec Deck 4×10, Reverse Fly’s (on incline bench) 4×8, Weighted Sit Ups 4x failure, Hanging Leg Raises 4x failure, Side Bends 4x failure, Side Crunches 4x failure, Wrist Curl Behind Back 4x failure, Reverse Wrist Curl Over Bench 4x failure</p><p><strong>Day Four: Triceps/Biceps</strong><br>Close Grip Bench Press 4×8, Pushdowns 4×8, EZ Bar Skull Crushers 4×10, Cable Kickbacks 4×8, EZ Bar Curls 4×8, Wide Grip Curls 4×8, Hammer Curls 4×8 (each hand), Concentration Curls 4×8</p><p><strong>Day Five: Legs/Abs</strong><br>Squats 4×12, Squat (to bench) 4×12, Bulgarian Squat 4×12, Quad Extensions 4×16, Stiff Leg Deadlift 4×12, Leg Curls 4×16, Glute Kickbacks 4×20, Calf Machine Raises 4×20, Seated Calf Raises 4×20, Leg Press Calf Raises 4×20, Weighted Sit up 4x failure, Air Bike 4x failure, Side Bends 4x failure, Barbell Twists 4x failure</p><p>Days 6 and 7 are rest days.</p><h2>Lazar Angelov Diet</h2><p>His diet is mostly low in carbohydrates all year round. Lazar loves keeping his fats high, both saturated and unsaturated. He says that this helps him to keep his testosterone high, which in turn, helps in burning fat and retaining muscle mass. There was a time when Lazar would diet using the ketogenic method. However, he no more prefers that method because it reduces muscle mass and body fat. Lazar now prefers to go for very long periods on a low-carb approach to get the best results. His daily diet is as follows:</p><p>1st Meal: Oatmeal, Eggs, Peanut Butter & Grapefruit<br>2nd Meal: Rice, Chicken & Broccoli<br>3rd Meal: Pasta, Tuna Fish & Avocado<br>4th Meal: Rice, Chicken<br>5th Meal: Salmon & Green Salad<br>6th Meal: Cottage Cheese & Broccoli</p><h2>Lazar Angelov Bodybuilder</h2><p>He went through his fair share of tough times after he started out.&nbsp; Lazar worked as a personal trainer in the daytime and a security guard at night. Although those two jobs didn’t pay well, he kept on pushing and focusing on his goals of creating his physique of greatness. Lazar admits that it was hard work with long periods of little or no rest.</p><p>It was hard because he didn’t get enough rest, but it was worth it because it paid off. Achieving his dreams was no easy task, but maintaining what he has achieved, and the hours he has dedicated to making his dream into a reality is just as hard. Most people believe that once you have achieved the body that you always wanted, everything else comes easy after that. In fact, the hardest part is maintaining your physique over a long period of time.</p><p>It costs Lazar as much effort to stay in his shape as it cost him to achieve it. He has to give 100% all the time and if he starts living as most people do, he will quickly get out of shape. In terms of training intensity for Ectomorphs, Lazar likes to train heavily and with a lot of intensity. regardless of whether he’s cutting or bulking. “If you’re someone with an ectomorph body type, then you should be using heavy weights to maintain good muscle density”. Says Lazar.</p><p>There’s generally no set rule for his training routine for days of the week. Lazar listens to his body and if he needs to rest he’ll rest, but if he needs to train a certain muscle group, he’ll make sure he targets that area. Lazar is able to do this because of the years of knowing his own body and what works best for him. He always incorporates basic exercises such as squats, bench presses, and deadlifts in his training routine. However, he always tries to make them different each time to provoke new muscle responses.</p><h2>Lazar Angelov Injury | Surgery</h2><p>He suddenly stopped training between late 2020 and early 2021 and many of his followers were confused and curious to know what happened to this Bulgarian bodybuilder and model who rose to fame when online fitness became a hit. Lazar posted a video on his channel on January 5, 2021, explaining his situation. Apparently, the model had to undergo knee and elbow surgeries and this was what kept him from exercising for a long period. The surgery is possibly connected to his past injury when playing professional basketball.</p><p>Some of those who accused him of being an unnatural athlete claim that steroid use is to blame for his unfortunate experience. They were insisting that Lazar used drugs that caused cartilage and ligaments fragile. He underwent successful surgery and revealed that he was fine but weighed 102kg after his operations. After full recovery, Lazar cut down his weight to 90 kgs. It should be noted that Lazar is an outspoken opponent of steroid use and has grown his body without them.
