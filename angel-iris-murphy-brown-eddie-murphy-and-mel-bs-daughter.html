Her father is an award-winning actor best known for his roles in 48 Hours, Beverly Hills Cop, The Nutty Professor, and Dolemite Is My Name.</strong></p><p>Angel’s mother, Melanie Janine Brown, also known as Mel B, is a well-known artist like her father. Mel is a singer, songwriter, and TV personality who rose to prominence as a member of the British girl group Spice Girls. Angel has piqued the interest of many of her parents’ admirers as the daughter of such well-known musicians.</p><p>So, in this article, we will delve into the celebrity daughter’s inner life, including her age, early life, parent-child relationship, siblings, and much more.</p><h2><span id=Angel_Iris_Murphy_Brown_Eddie_Murphy8217s_daughter_is_how_old>Angel Iris Murphy Brown, Eddie Murphy’s daughter, is how old?</span></h2><p>Angel will be 15 years old in 2023. On April 3, 2007, she was born on her father Eddie’s 45th birthday in Santa Monica, California, under the birth sign Aries. Angel weighed 5 pounds at the time of her delivery.</p><p>In actuality, the famous child was raised only by her mother because her parents divorced before she was born.</p><p>Eddie, Irish’s biological father, even questioned whether the unborn child was of his blood or not while she was in her mother’s womb. Eddie stated,</p><p>“I don’t know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test.”</p><p>Angel spent her youth under the care of her mother Melanie and stepfather Stephen Belafonte.</p><p>Furthermore, Eddie Murphy’s daughter Angel was born in the United States. Her father is Afro-American and her mother is of African-Nevisian and English origin, hence she comes from a mixed ethnic background.</p><h2><span id=The_Meaning_of_Angel8217s_Name>The Meaning of Angel’s Name</span></h2><p>Isn’t Eddie and Mel B’s only Angel’s name very long? Melanie explained in an exclusive interview about her daughter’s name, Angel, that there is a meaning behind it. She stated</p><p>She is my angel, my little angel during my pregnancy. Iris is my grandmother’s name, Murphy is my father’s name, and Brown is my mother’s name!</p><h2><span id=Siblings_of_Angel_Iris_Murphy_Brown>Siblings of Angel Iris Murphy Brown</span></h2><p>As previously stated, Angel is her parents’ only child. However, due to her parents’ multiple relationships with their various partners, the star child has 11 siblings in total. Murphy Brown has an older half-brother, Eric Murphy, from her father’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend Paulette McNeely. Angel’s father, likewise, welcomed his kid Christian Murphy with his ex-partner Tamara Hood.</p><p>Iris has older half-siblings Bria, Miles, Shayne, Zola, and Bella Murphy from her father’s marriage to his ex-wife Nicole Mitchell. She also has two younger half-siblings, Izzy and Max Murphy, from her father’s relationship with Australian model Paige Butcher.</p><p>Angel also has half-sisters Madison Brown Belafonte, born on September 1, 2011, in Los Angeles, California, and Phoenix Brown from her mother’s two separate relationships. Phoenix, her older half-sister, was born in February 1999 as the result of her mother Mel B’s 16-month marriage to Dutch backing dancer Jimmy Gulzar.</p><p>Phoenix previously appeared in the Channel 4 TV show “Born Famous.”</p><p>Angel’s father initially denied her as his daughter, and they were subjected to a paternity test.</p><p>While Angel’s mother Mel was pregnant, her father raised the issue of the unborn child. He even wanted a paternity test before Angel was born, but afterwards denied it. However, the actor was persuaded to take the test within a month. Eddie went for a DNA paternity test at a Beverly Hills medical facility after two months of childbirth, despite the fact that he was not prepared for it at the time.</p><p>Meanwhile, Murphy’s father was dating his new girlfriend Tracey Edmonds, who mentioned the DNA test and said,</p><p>“There will be a paternity test, and if it is [Eddie’s], he will be held accountable.”</p><p>The following June, DNA tests revealed that Eddie was the father of Angel. Mel, her mother, stated in this regard,</p><p>“He’s the baby’s father, it’s official,” “The baby is, without a doubt, 100 percent his.”</p><p>Despite the fact that the test revealed Ediie is Angel’s real father, the Nutty Professor actor did not approach building a relationship with his child for a long time.</p><h2><span id=Angel_Iris_Murphy_Brown8217s_Relationship_With_Her_Father_How_Is_It_Today>Angel Iris Murphy Brown’s Relationship With Her Father: How Is It Today?</span></h2><p>Angel, who is 15 years old, currently enjoys a wonderful relationship with her funny father Eddie. Angel’s mother commended Eddie’s mother Lillian Lynch for the closeness Angel has with her father today in her novel Brutally Honest.</p><p>He is now a wonderful father to his kid, according to a close source.</p><p>“He always makes a point of getting them involved with Angel.” She (Angel) is always texting and talking on the phone with Eddie. She adores her father.”</p><p>“And he (Eddie) gives her all the gifts,” “There are 150 boxes under the tree at Christmas… You name it: gowns, shoes, toys, her birthday, literally every occasion.”</p><p>Angel’s father has also maintained a positive relationship with her mother. Eddie and Mel B are currently co-parenting their 15-year-old daughter.</p><p>Angel spent the majority of her time with her mother, although she also spent time with her father. She was forced to live with her father in Los Angeles after her mother, Mel B, underwent emergency surgery in England in late 2018 after breaking two ribs.</p><h2><span id=Murphy_Angel_Irish_Parents_of_Brown_Eddie_Murphy_and_Melanie_B_Were_Not_Married>Murphy, Angel Irish Parents of Brown Eddie Murphy and Melanie B Were Not Married</span></h2><p>Eddie and Melanie, Angel’s parents, were in a relationship in 2006. They had a brief romance that lasted approximately six months. The ex-lovers originally met at Eddie’s Beverly Hills house during a party, and they were instantly attracted to each other.</p><p>Melanie Brown, Brown’s mother, admitted that their first meeting was love at first sight for her. Mel B wrote in her 2018 memoir, Brutally Honest,</p><p>“I felt a hundred different emotions all at once, everything from confused to elated, happy to scared, relaxed to incredulous, and everything in between.”</p><p>The Lullaby singer went on to say,</p><p>“I felt like I’d known this man my entire life and that I was staring my destiny in the face.”</p><p>Eddie later approached Brown, and their romance bloomed. However, their relationship quickly devolved into a toxic one. According to the Quantum Leap actress, her lover Eddie abruptly left her and later denied the existence of their baby, which was conceived through planning. Their romance terminated in December 2006. And four months later, Melanie Brown gave birth to his child Angel, and Eddie did not pay a visit to see his child’s face.</p><h2><span id=Angel8217s_mother_filed_a_lawsuit_against_Eddie_Murphy_for_increased_child_support>Angel’s mother filed a lawsuit against Eddie Murphy for increased child support.</span></h2><p>Angel’s mother Melanie filed proceedings in court against her ex-partner Eddie seeking extra child support in October 2020, following the COVID breakup. Previously, the actor was forced to pay $25,000 per month during the paternity settlement in 2009, but owing to the epidemic, Brown returned to court to request additional financial aid. During the pandemic, her income plummeted substantially.</p><p>After two years, the stand-up comic agreed to pay an additional $35,000 a month in child support, an increase of $10,000. He has recently been described as a “extraordinarily high earner.” According to the court’s decision, he is obligated to pay child support until Angel reaches the age of 18.</p><h2><span id=Angel_Iris_Murphy_Brown_Showed_Up_On_Her_Mother8217s_Instagram>Angel Iris Murphy Brown Showed Up On Her Mother’s Instagram</span></h2><p>In terms of social media handles, it’s clear that the 15-year-old celebrity child is still finding her way in the media world. Her fans, on the other hand, got to see her frequently on her mother Mel B’s Instagram account, which has 1.5 million followers.</p><p>She also appears on her half-sibling’s Instagram account, particularly on her older brother Eric Murphy’s Instagram.</p><h2><span id=What_Will_Angel_Irish_Be_Up_To_In_2023>What Will Angel Irish Be Up To In 2023?</span></h2><p>According to her age, the singer’s daughter is currently a high school student. Angel Iris Murphy Brown graduated from junior high school in 2018, which her mother also stated on Instagram with the statement,</p><p>Angel, please accept my heartfelt congrats.Happy graduation, my love, how you have grown up, how much you are loved, glad I and your family were there today supporting and cheering you on!!!The rest of the world better watch out because she’s a genius!!!!</p><p>She lives with her mother and two half-sisters from her mother’s side.</p><p>Angel was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, and her mother grants her every request, while her father stands by her side as her backup.</p><h2><span id=Angel_Murphy8217s_Parents_Have_a_Million_Dollar_Net_Worth>Angel Murphy’s Parents Have a Million Dollar Net Worth</span></h2><p>Angel’s father, Eddie Murphy, is expected to be worth $200 million as of 2023, while her mother is worth $6 million. There’s little doubt that they made a lot of money from their expanded entertainment career.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/simon-sinek-motivating-speech-on-wife-relationship/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Daughter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Bebelle Harcott</a></h3>Bebelle Harcott is known as a celebrity child because her parents' celebrity thrust her into the spotlight at such a young age.
