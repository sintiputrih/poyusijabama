Similarly, in response to a question regarding his wedding, Kerri’s husband stated,</p><p>It was a great time. On New Year’s Eve, we had it in Northern California. That night, I was just hazy with affection. Still, it was a huge event! It resembles staging a one-night-only performance. You’re busy because you’re the star, director, and producer. You have a lot going on because you’re the host as well. I would like to retry it.</p><p>The couple has been together and leading a happy married life ever since getting married.
