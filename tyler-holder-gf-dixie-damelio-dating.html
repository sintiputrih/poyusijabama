And with the bigger deal of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Charli D'Amelio</strong></a> & <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chase Hudson</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bryce Hall</strong></a> & <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Addison Rae</strong></a> taking over, there are barely others that stand out.</p><p>However, aside from the ones widely discussed, many of the TikTok stars whose relationship gets shadowed by the rumors of the more high-profile ones do have a happy, confirmed BF-GF relationship. And as the sister of the most-followed TikTok user, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dixie D'Amelio</strong></a> surely does get the attention in the dating world.</p><p>But with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dixie leaving Hype House</a> with her sister, she's found a guy to be with on her own time. But she hasn't strayed far. Sway House member <strong>Griffin Johnson</strong> recently just confirmed Dixie is his GF now. But was there ever a thing between her and Hype House's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tyler Holder</strong></a>?</p><h2>Many Believed One Photo Sealed Tayler Holder and Dixie D'Amelio BF-GF Status in January</h2><p>When the Hype House was formed in December 2019, there already were a few sparks flying around the group, not that they were high-profile yet. But as the collaborative got traction, Charli's rumors with Chase got people wondering is Dixie is someone's girlfriend. And they noticed she was closer to Tayler Holder than the other members.</p><p>There were a lot of signs as time went on — like that New Year's celebration! But at the end of January 2020, Tayler posted a photo on Instagram that fans deemed the deal sealer for a confirmation of a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. Tayler had a female hand on his, showing only their legs of course, and not mentioning it was Dixie's, despite tagging her as the female hand. She did reply with a heart emoji in the comments.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2020/07/aab7830e7ea0c59d245651b02d9d25ac.jpg alt="Taylor Holder and Dixie D'Amelio's hands in the aforementioned Instagram post." width=450 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Photo Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tayler Holder, Instagram</a></strong></p><p>There were no signs of a Valentine's Day tribute for each other, and some fans may have been disappointed, but that just meant there were no more than friends. If that doesn't explain the nature of their relationship back then, the series of videos <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Alex Warren</strong></a> made trying to get the Hype House members to kiss each other might.</p><p><strong>Must-See: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avani Gregg's Start with Dating Anthony Reeves Is a Little Confusing</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Yeah, Dixie and Tayler had their own segment from Warren who tried making them kiss. And they would have, had they not been interrupted by Charli, who was playing with a light-saber a few seconds before. But they did later settle their relationship being in the friendzone for now.</p><p></p><p>And of course, by the end of February 2020, Dixie was already cozying up to now-boyfriend Griffin Johnson, who she later played a couple on the Brat TV series, Attaway General (rated "not good" by Dr. <strong>Mike</strong>, by the way, in medical perspectives). Tayler also later confirmed they were just friends during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Hollywire</a> in March 2020, joking that she friend-zoned him.</p><p>We all know what actually happened now. And it's worth mentioning, the name <strong>Matt Garavel</strong> was popping up as her boyfriend, although, he was only a prom date in May 2018.</p><h2>Was Tayler Holder Missing His Ex-GF Kaylyn Slevin with Those Broken-Hearted Posts?</h2><p>Back in 2018, just during the early parts of her acting career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tayler Holder</a> was linked with <strong>Kylee Renee</strong>. But that soon shifted when he found a new best friend, actress <strong>Indiana Massara</strong>, while acting on Dirt for the first time. But when 2019 rolled in, there was someone better in his life, someone to be his GF for a few months.</p><p>Tayler Holder and aspiring model, actress & cheerleader <strong>Kaylyn Slevin</strong> confirmed their BF-GF relationship in May 2019 as he posted a whole YouTube video about it, titled '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ITS OFFICIAL!</a>'. But by August 2019, their relationship came to a halt. And yeah, they made another YouTube video together, indicating no bad blood between them during separation. He was assured they'd hang out still, but that's gone.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p>And just in February 2020, Holder was posting some weird tweets again and again — something that indicated he was missing an ex-girlfriend from the past, recreating posts he made with Slevin and also third-wheeling other couples around him. Yeah, he liked messing up romantic photos. The tweets were "emo", as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywire explains it</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Do you ever miss someone but never let them know because you have this feeling that they are doing just fine without you?</p><p>— Tayler Holder (@TaylerHolder) <a href=# rel=noopener>February 21, 2020</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>It was not distinguishable who these tweets referred to, but many of them pointed to former girlfriend Kaylyn. Or whether any of the others were lines from Drake's music. But for now, one thing is clear. He sure is enjoying his time with suspected girlfriend <strong>Sommer Ray</strong>.
