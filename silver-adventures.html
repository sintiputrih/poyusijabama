In stealing the Pokémon, Silver made himself a rival in <a href=# title="Gold (Adventures)">Gold</a>, who thought that he was the one who stole his <a href=# title=Bag>backpack</a> that had all of his Pokémon in it and later because of his theft of <a href=# title="Totodile (Pokémon)">Totodile</a>. Before they could finish their first battle which had taken place at Professor Elm's lab right after Silver stole Totodile, Gold was knocked unconscious by several members of <a href=# title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket</a>, who Silver subsequently defeated. During the battle, Gold was able to burn his hand forcing Silver to throw one of his gloves off. As a result, Gold learned from the name emblazoned in the glove that the boy's name was Silver.

When an iron wrecking ball was launched at them, Silver and Gold teamed up with their respective first partner Pokémon (Exbo and Totodile) to destroy the ball by rapidly heating the ball and then cooling it. Silver then disappeared again, with Totodile evolving into <a href=# title="Croconaw (Pokémon)">Croconaw</a>.</p><p>Silver then takes a Black Apricorn to <a href=# title=Kurt>Kurt</a>, who makes a <a href=# title="Heavy Ball">Heavy Ball</a> for him, saying that he only gives his Balls to Trainers he feels are qualified and that Silver is good enough. Silver used this Heavy Ball to capture an <a href=# title="Ursaring (Pokémon)">Ursaring</a>. However, Gold ran into him while he was in the middle of the capture. Gold got in his way several times (for example when Aibo ran into Silver and made him drop his Heavy Ball). Silver then told Gold how to properly use Kurt's Balls. He stated that every Pokémon has a point that the Trainer must hit with the Ball in order for it to work (for Teddiursa, the crescent moon on its forehead and for Ursaring, its belly, for example). Gold repaid Silver by using his <a href=# title="Friend Ball">Friend Ball</a> and billiard cue to knock back Silver's Heavy Ball, and were both able to catch their targets. Silver then, once again, disappeared. He appeared at the Slowpoke Well in the middle of Team Rocket's Slowpoke Tail scam and defeated all of the Grunts single-handedly. Ursaring's claw marks were seen on one part of the well, so people quickly realized that it was him.</p><p>Silver then appears in Ecruteak City, looking over the damage from the air with his <a href=# title="Murkrow (Pokémon)">Murkrow</a>. Jasmine's <a href=# title=Amphy>Amphy</a>'s flare then caught Silver's attention and he found her in the <a href=# title="Bell Tower">Tin Tower</a> and decided to help her, only to run into Gold who thought he did harm to her instead. Before Gold could spark a battle, Silver just handed her over to him and left. However a mudslide left them trapped in the tower but Silver got Gold's <a href=# title=Polibo>Polibo</a> to evolve into a Politoed and get them out right before they drowned in the silt, only to find out Team Rocket was the cause of the earthquake. Once Silver and Gold defeat the grunts they retreat and Gold requests a battle, to which Silver accepts. After a long battle he reveals several new additions to his team, a <a href=# title="Kingdra (Pokémon)">Kingdra</a> that evolved during the exchange with Politoed, and a <a href=# title="Tyranitar (Pokémon)">Tyranitar</a> that wasn't his and thereby, could not control.

There, he tries calling out to Lance to ask him about the apparent revival of Team Rocket, but gets no answer. He is attacked by the Blackthorn Gym Leader, <a href=# title=Clair>Clair</a>, who is also searching for the currently missing Lance. They are attacked by a large group of <a href=# title="Koffing (Pokémon)">Koffing</a>, but Silver easily defeats them with his Pokémon. When one of the Koffing tries to escape, Silver has his Sneasel take the item it was holding in its mouth, a <a href=# title=Plate>Plate</a>. After his Sneasel and Murkrow evolve into Weavile and Honchkrow, respectively, Silver flies off to the <a href=# title="Johto Safari Zone">Safari Zone</a> after getting a clue to Lance's current whereabouts.</p><p>After arriving at the Safari Zone, Silver encounters <a href=# title=Eusine>Eusine</a>, who is trying to sell his poorly-drawn images of <a href=# title="Suicune (Pokémon)">Suicune</a>. There, they are attacked by <a href=# title=Petrel>Petrel</a>, one of the <a href=# title="Executive (Trainer class)">Executives</a> of Team Rocket. Silver manages to defeat Petrel, and takes the Plates he had in his possession. After Petrel escapes, Silver tries to search for more of the Plates, but is unable to find any. Soon after, he encounters Crystal, who came to the Safari Zone on a trip with the children from the <a href=# title="Earl Dervish">orphanage</a> she works at. Upon Eusine's suggestion, Silver and Crystal decide to go meet the Ecruteak Gym Leader, <a href=# title=Morty>Morty</a>, who can find Lance with his psychic powers. After arriving at <a href=# title="Johto Route 38">Route 38</a>, Silver is pinned to a tree by another of the Team Rocket Executives, <a href=# title=Ariana>Ariana</a>. As Crystal battles Ariana alone, Silver manages to piece together that the Plates each correspond to sixteen of the seventeen Pokémon types.</p><p>With this knowledge, Silver gives the Earth Plate he stole from Petrel to his <a href=# title="Rhyperior (Pokémon)">Rhyperior</a>. He has Rhyperior attack Ariana with a powerful <a href=# title="Earth Power (move)">Earth Power</a>, which manages to distract her long enough for him to escape. Although he regrets having to leave Crystal behind, Silver decides to go to the Ecruteak Gym and go to Morty. Upon arriving at the Gym, Silver is approached by the Gym Leaders of the Violet, Cianwood, and Azalea Gyms, <a href=# title=Falkner>Falkner</a>, <a href=# title=Chuck>Chuck</a>, and <a href=# title=Bugsy>Bugsy</a>. They reveal that because of several requests to use Morty's powers, they have been asked to guard the Gym for him. Due to not having time, Silver is forced to battle the three, but the battle is ended once it's revealed that Silver's Rhyperior is the Rhydon that Blue used to own.</p><p>Silver reveals that after the events of the <a href=# title="Emerald arc (Adventures)"><i>Emerald</i> arc</a>, he and Blue went to his hideout to get his father. However, due to it being over several months since he had Ursaring bring Giovanni there, the both of them are missing. Although they failed to find Giovanni, Silver has Blue trade his Rhyperior to him, allowing it to evolve into its final form. Blue decides to let Silver keep Rhyperior, as he needs a sixth Pokémon to replace Ursaring.</p><p>Chuck, being Blue's former master, decides to allow Silver into the Gym because Blue is friends with Silver. Upon entering the Gym, Silver is shocked to see Gold is there as well. Before Silver can ask Morty to help him, the legendary Pokémon, <a href=# title="Arceus (Pokémon)">Arceus</a> appears and blows away the Gym with a powerful attack. The attack knocks Silver and Morty unconscious, while Gold goes to face Arceus by himself. Later, Silver awakens in the destroyed Ecruteak Gym and prepares to go and follow Gold. Before he leaves, Silver has Morty use his clairvoyance to map out each of the locations of all the remaining Plates. Silver has his Weavile carve marks into trees, which are then picked up by other wild <a href=# title="Sneasel (Pokémon)">Sneasel</a> and <a href=# title="Weavile (Pokémon)">Weavile</a> all around Johto. As he goes to obtain the remaining Plates, Silver calls Gold to find out his location so that he can arrive there after finishing his mission. Sometime later, with the help of the wild and trained Sneasel and Weavile of Johto, Silver obtains the remaining thirteen Plates and goes off to find Gold. Soon after, he finds Crystal, injured after a battle with Arceus and left on top of a tree.</p><p>He thanks Crystal for helping hold back Team Rocket and takes her to the Ruins of Alph, where Gold currently is. Upon arriving, they find Gold in battle with Arceus and rush in to help him. Arceus reacts to the Plates inside Silver's pocket, which causes it to send Silver, Gold, Crystal, and the Executives into a snow-filled area called the <a href=# title="Sinjoh Ruins">Sinjoh Ruins</a>.</p><p>Upon entering, Silver, Gold, and Crystal find Arceus being dragged onto the Mystri Stage by the Executives' Pokémon. With Arceus as their hostage, the Executives force Silver to hand over his Plates. Silver and the others try to stop the Executives, but are blocked by Petrel, Ariana, and Proton, who stall them long enough for <a href=# title=Archer>Archer</a> to use the Plates to activate Arceus' <a href=# title="Multitype (Ability)">Multitype</a> Ability. With the power of Arceus's different types, Archer wreaks havoc while Silver, Crystal and Gold are powerless to stop him. Soon, Archer reveals his true plan with Arceus: to re-create the legendary Pokémon, <a href=# title="Pokémon of Myth (Adventures)">Dialga</a>, <a href=# title="Pokémon of Myth (Adventures)">Palkia</a>, and <a href=# title="Pokémon of Myth (Adventures)">Giratina</a> for their boss, Giovanni. Hearing Giovanni's name startles Silver, which allows Petrel to sneak up on him and reveal that he learned that Silver is the son of Giovanni because of Carr.</p><p>Petrel has his <a href=# title="Golbat (Pokémon)">Golbat</a> use <a href=# title="Lick (move)">Lick</a> on Silver, which blinds Silver and paralyzes his throat, making him mute. Petrel reveals that he intends to betray his teammates by convincing Giovanni that he tried to protect the injured Silver from Archer and the others who had harmed him. Although Silver questions why he would go along with the plan, Petrel reveals that since Silver is Giovanni's son, he will most likely turn out as evil as his father. Silver realizes that Petrel is right, and that he cannot escape his fate of being connected to evil. Silver decides to kill himself by jumping towards the three Pokémon being created by Arceus, forcing Petrel to try and stop him. Crystal tries to stop Silver, but Gold reveals that it's all a ruse, and that Silver lent his Feraligatr to him. With the power of the Ultimate Moves, Gold and Crystal destroy the Pokémon that Arceus created.</p><p>Having stopped Team Rocket's plan, Arceus sends the Executives flying and completes itself by absorbing the Plates. After Crystal heals Silver with Parasee, the three are shocked to find the pieces of Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina that were destroyed are quickly reforming. Archer reveals that even though they appeared to have destroyed the trio, all they did was temporarily stop the process from completing. Since Arceus had finished completing itself, the process that created Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina started again, allowing it to finish. Archer begins going crazy, and begins claiming that everything is destined; the creation of Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina, Arceus completing itself, the world becoming Team Rocket's, all destined. His insanity begins to scare his teammates, which leads to Petrel attempting to escape by disguising himself as Giovanni.</p><p>Then, Giovanni appears before all of them, but Silver quickly assumes it's just a disguised Petrel. The real Petrel appears with his disguised ripped apart by Silver's Ursaring, revealing Giovanni to be the real one. Giovanni reveals that he didn't come alone, as Lance and Pryce soon join him. The three Trainers begin combating the Pokémon, and manage to hold them off for a little while. When Gold questions how Pryce returned, the man reveals that the one who saved him from the crack in time was Celebi, who could see the destruction that Arceus would bring with the legendary Pokémon it created.</p><p>When Giovanni, Lance, and Pryce take their battle outside, Silver and Crystal follow them, while Gold stays behind to calm Arceus down. Giovanni's disease begins affecting him, forcing Silver to step in and defend his ailing father from Giratina. After Gold calms Arceus down, Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina leave, ending the battle completely. After Giovanni gets his disease cured, he offers Silver a position in Team Rocket. Silver refuses, and instead decides to get stronger so that he can one day change his father's evil ways. Proud of his son's decision, Giovanni entrusts Lance and Pryce to train Silver so that he may one day face his son in combat.</p><p>Later, Silver gains in interest in <a href=# title="Proteam Omega">Proteam Omega</a>, a show that was created by the <a href=# title="Radio Director">Radio Director</a>.
