One of those people was r<a href=#>apper NBA Youngboy</a> (whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden), who is currently facing charges for, according to news reports, drug possession, drug distribution, a felon in possession of a firearm, and stolen weaponry. However, his attorney claims <a href=#>NBA Youngboy</a> isn't guilty. A mugshot of the rapper has been shared on a fan Instagram page with the caption, "New mugshot, Free Youngboy."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Kentrell is not guilty of any crimes. There's nothing in the reports that indicates that he did anything wrong. They arrested several people and there was no indication that he had any guns or drugs on him at the time of the arrest. I ultimately believe he will be found innocent in all of this," James Manasseh, <a href=# rel=nofollow>NBA YoungBoy's lawyer stated</a>, per a local news outlet. In addition to the drugs and stolen guns, apparently the police found $79,000 in cash on the individuals. However, even though NBA Youngboy might be in some legal trouble, people are actually more interested in...rapper's forehead.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to NBA Youngboy's head?</h2><p>NBA Youngboy has scars his forehead, and they're from an accident. The rapper explained, in a YouTube video, that the scars resulted from a halo, which is a brace that's used to wear when one has a neck injury. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Halos are metal medical devices</a> used to "stabilize the cervical spine after traumatic injuries to the neck, or after spine surgery." NBA Youngboy needed a halo implanted after he broke his neck while wrestling when he was a four-year-old.&nbsp;</p><p>NBA <a href=# rel=nofollow>Youngboy says he was lucky</a> and that he was immediately rushed to the hospital so that doctors could save his life. The rapper said the incident could have killed him, but that god blessed him."God blessed me. I’m a blessed child," he said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Back in April people were wondering why <a href=#>NBA Youngboy cleared his Instagram account</a> after facing some major personal drama. "You know why I deleted my pictures off my page? [...] Women trying to incriminate me. Posting stupid shit. Well, they say stupid shit. I guess the people that they down talk a n--ga with leaked the shit. I don't know. That shit be playing mind games. Well, I be playing mind games with myself because I be letting it eat me up," he explained in an Instagram Live with Bway Yungy.&nbsp;He didn't explain what he meant or what happened with the women trying to incriminate him, however.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>However, some think it's because he got into a fight with Kodak Black, who believed he had something to do with Iyanna Mayweather's arrest. The rapper, according to The Blast, claimed that <a href=# rel=nofollow>NBA Youngboy "cooperated"</a> with authorities, leading to Mayweather's arrest.</p><p>Back in December 2019, a judge prematurely ended his probation (NBA Youngboy was arrested in May 2019 for his involvement in a shootout in Florida). “I see growth in you, I hope that things go well for you," the judge stated at the time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSnmpFixrDBzaCZqLFdnbKisA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-nba-youngboy-head.html&text=What%20Happened%20to%20NBA%20Youngboy%27s%20Head%3f%20Here%27s%20How%20the%20Rapper%20Got%20Those%20Scars&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-nba-youngboy-head.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-nba-youngboy-head.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20NBA%20Youngboy%27s%20Head%3f%20Here%27s%20How%20the%20Rapper%20Got%20Those%20Scars" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-nba-youngboy-head.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20NBA%20Youngboy%27s%20Head%3f%20Here%27s%20How%20the%20Rapper%20Got%20Those%20Scars" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-nba-youngboy-head.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20NBA%20Youngboy%27s%20Head%3f%20Here%27s%20How%20the%20Rapper%20Got%20Those%20Scars" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-nba-youngboy-head.html&description=What%20Happened%20to%20NBA%20Youngboy%27s%20Head%3f%20Here%27s%20How%20the%20Rapper%20Got%20Those%20Scars" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-barry-windham-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Barry Windham Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rose-matafeo-husband-or-partner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maggie Sajak Husband Or Partner: Is She Married?
