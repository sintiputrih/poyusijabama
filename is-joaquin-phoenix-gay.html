The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Joker</a> actor has never dated a man in real life. He has only dated women in his past relationships and is currently happily married to his wife, Rooney Mara.</p><p>Therefore, it is obvious that Joaquin Phoenix is straight and not gay. However, he is widely known to support the LGBTQ+ community despite being heterosexual.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Mingus Reedus Gay?

He has taken part in several activities and initiatives to advance the rights of LGBTQ+ people and has spoken out against prejudice and discrimination.</p><p>Phoenix joined famous people who signed a letter in 2016 calling for a boycott of the Oscars because of the lack of diversity in the nominees. His talks and public appearances have emphasized the interconnectedness of social justice concerns, including LGBTQ+ rights, as well as his involvement in animal rights advocacy.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Is Dwyane Wade Gay?

Both Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix are well-known actors in the movie business, and they have been dating since 2016. They initially got to know one another while on the set of the movie “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Her</a>” in 2013, but they didn’t start dating until a few years later.</p><p>Only a few aspects of the couple’s relationship are known to the general public since they want to keep their private lives secret. They have, however, occasionally been in public together and captured on camera at different occasions and award ceremonies.</p><p>In the 2019 movie “Mary Magdalene,” Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix collaborated once more on the project. Mara played the title role, while Phoenix played Jesus Christ. They probably have a lot in common because of their love of acting and commitment to their jobs.</p><p>It was revealed in September 2020 that the couple had given birth to a baby they had named River in honor of Joaquin Phoenix’s late brother. It took several months before the public was informed of this news.</p><p>The relationship between Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix has been characterized as low-key and private since both performers like to keep their private lives apart from their public personas. They have opted to keep some privacy by not going into great detail about their relationship in interviews or on social media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Frequently Asked Questions About Joaquin Phoenix</h2><h3 class=rank-math-question>Who is Joaquin Phoenix?</h3><p>Joaquin Phoenix is an American actor and producer.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question>Is Joaquin Phoenix Gay?</h3><p>No, Joaquin Phoenix is not gay.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question>Who is Joaquin Phoenix’s Boyfriend?</h3><p>Joaquin Phoenix is straight and doesn’t have a boyfriend.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question>Is Joaquin Phoenix Dating Todd Haynes?</h3><p>Although they will be portraying gay romance on screen in the new movie, neither of them has confirmed the dating rumors.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question>Who is Joaquin Phoenix’s Wife?</h3><p>Joaquin Phoenix is married to the actress Rooney Mara.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question>What is Joaquin Phoenix’s Net Worth?</h3><p>Joaquin Phoenix has an estimated net worth of $60 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2K3sK3QrqCnZaCdvKa6yLFkoJmpZH95gZJxZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-joaquin-phoenix-gay.html&text=Is%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Gay%3f%20Portraying%20a%20Gay%20Romance%20on%20Screen%20with%20Todd%20Haynes%20Sparks%20Rumors%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-joaquin-phoenix-gay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-joaquin-phoenix-gay.html&title=Is%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Gay%3f%20Portraying%20a%20Gay%20Romance%20on%20Screen%20with%20Todd%20Haynes%20Sparks%20Rumors%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-joaquin-phoenix-gay.html&title=Is%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Gay%3f%20Portraying%20a%20Gay%20Romance%20on%20Screen%20with%20Todd%20Haynes%20Sparks%20Rumors%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-joaquin-phoenix-gay.html&title=Is%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Gay%3f%20Portraying%20a%20Gay%20Romance%20on%20Screen%20with%20Todd%20Haynes%20Sparks%20Rumors%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-joaquin-phoenix-gay.html&description=Is%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Gay%3f%20Portraying%20a%20Gay%20Romance%20on%20Screen%20with%20Todd%20Haynes%20Sparks%20Rumors%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./love-is-blind-alexa-alfia-age-height-job-and-wikipedia-bio-459221-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Love Is Blind: Alexa Alfia Age Height Job And Wikipedia Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./charles-rookwoods-trial-puzzle-solution.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hogwarts Legacy Charles Rookwood Trial Puzzle Solution">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
