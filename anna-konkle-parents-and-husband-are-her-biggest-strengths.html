Her mother is a retired nurse and her father passed away from lung cancer.</p><p>The actress is most recognized for her work on Hulu’s original TV comedy series “PEN 15” (2019). She co-created the show alongside Maya Erskine and Sam Zvibleman and starred as Anna Kone.</p><p>Interestingly, her effort on the series led to her receiving two Primetime Emmy Award nominations: one for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series in 2019 and another for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021.</p><p>She debuted in the acting industry in 2013. Just two years after making her television debut, the actress received the lead role in the TV show “Rosewood.” The opportunity proved to be a significant break, helping her to gain more recognition.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Anna Konkle Lived In A Complicated Family">Anna Konkle Lived In A Complicated Family</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Inside Her Married Life">Inside Her Married Life</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anna-konkle-lived-in-a-complicated-family></span>Anna Konkle Lived In A Complicated Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anna Konkle parents Peter and Janet Ryan separated when she was just a teenager. They&nbsp;announced their divorce in 2000.</p><p>In 1994, her family relocated to Scituate, Massachusetts, where she attended public schools. As per&nbsp;newyorker.com, her mother, Janet, a retired nurse, and her father, Peter, didn’t have a healthy marriage.</p><p>It led them to announce their divorce in 2000, but the judicial proceedings took three years. Throughout that period, Konkle’s father, Peter, refuses to leave the family home. The home was divided between two opposing territories, with Konkle frequently acting as a mediator.</p><p>Even though Peter and Janet did not have a warm relationship, they supported one another while co-parenting Anna. They fulfilled their parenting responsibilities by giving their daughter a good education and assisting her in choosing a career she was always interested.</p><p>Anna also&nbsp;shared&nbsp;a few pictures that captured moments with her mother on Instagram. She posted a picture with her mother in 2015, wishing everyone a happy day after Thanksgiving.</p><p>Later in 2018, she&nbsp;uploaded&nbsp;an image of herself as a child with her mother wearing weird makeup. She captioned the picture, “Just a normal throwback picture of my mom and me. Happy nightmares.”</p><p>Anna, unfortunately, had to deal with a devastating loss in 2019 when her father, Peter, passed away from lung cancer. A few months after his passing, the actress&nbsp;posted&nbsp;a lengthy, heartwarming statement on her Instagram account.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=inside-her-married-life></span>Inside Her Married Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anna Konkle boyfriend Alex Anfanger is an actor and producer. Anna and Alex got engaged in 2020 and have a beautiful daughter together.</p><p>Her fiance, like her, works in the entertainment industry. Alex is an actor, producer, and writer. He is best known for performing roles in “Cake,” “Burning Love,” and “Big Time in Hollywood, FL.”</p><p>Although they exchanged rings in a private ceremony to declare their engagement, the pair has not yet entered a legal marriage. As per&nbsp;Vogue, Konkle made a subtle disclosure that Alex had proposed to her.</p><p>From their relationship, they are proud parents of a child. In early 2021, the actress surprised her followers by&nbsp;announcing&nbsp;on Instagram that she was nine months pregnant.</p><p>Showing off her growing baby bump, she shared a couple of snapshots and wrote a caption, “It only took me nine months to post, but the family is expanding any second now.”</p><p>The couple then gave birth to their first child, a daughter they named Essie Wunderle Anfanger. Audiences were intrigued to learn more about their newly born child because of her unique name.</p><p>Essie’s second name, according to the actress, comes from her late father’s side of the family and was chosen in his honor. And the Wunderle was known for having powerful, independent women.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmeo65ut86noqWdXaWus7HNrapmmZ6ZeqnB0puYp5xdlr%2BmeceeqWaamZy0pr%2FTZqqtqpWjtLW00mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fanna-konkle-parents-and-husband-are-her-biggest-strengths.html&text=Anna%20Konkle%20Parents%20and%20Husband%20Are%20Her%20Biggest%20Strengths&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanna-konkle-parents-and-husband-are-her-biggest-strengths.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanna-konkle-parents-and-husband-are-her-biggest-strengths.html&title=Anna%20Konkle%20Parents%20and%20Husband%20Are%20Her%20Biggest%20Strengths" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fanna-konkle-parents-and-husband-are-her-biggest-strengths.html&title=Anna%20Konkle%20Parents%20and%20Husband%20Are%20Her%20Biggest%20Strengths" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fanna-konkle-parents-and-husband-are-her-biggest-strengths.html&title=Anna%20Konkle%20Parents%20and%20Husband%20Are%20Her%20Biggest%20Strengths" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanna-konkle-parents-and-husband-are-her-biggest-strengths.html&description=Anna%20Konkle%20Parents%20and%20Husband%20Are%20Her%20Biggest%20Strengths" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bird-in-hand-corporation-employee-michelle-miller-dies-due-to-explosion-in-lancaster.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bird-in-Hand Corporation Employee Michelle Miller dies due to explosion in Lancaster">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mikaela-foecke.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mikaela Foecke - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Married, Height, Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
