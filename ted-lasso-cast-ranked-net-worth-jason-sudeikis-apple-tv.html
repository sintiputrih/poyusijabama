Apple TV+ broke records for being the first streaming service to land an Emmy Award in a program category in only its second year of eligibility. The show and the cast are so beloved, so their salaries seem well deserved. Let's see how much the cast of Ted Lasso is currently worth!</p><h2 id=toheeb-jimoh-350-000><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Toheeb Jimoh: $350,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Toheeb Jimoh is an English actor known for his work in the series Ted Lasso, London Kills, and the Feed. Although he has only been acting for a couple of years, his role as Sam Obisanya in the series quickly made him a fan favorite. His secret romance on the series showed his softer side and made his character even more adorable.</p><h2 id=juno-temple-1-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Juno Temple: $1 Million</span></h2><p>Juno Temple is best known for her roles in the films Wild Child, Atonement, St Trinian's, Little Birds, Killer Joe, The Dark Knight Rises, and Afternoon Delight. She won over the world with her portrayal of the sweet Keeley Jones in Ted Lasso. Her romance with bad boy Roy Kent has become one of the most precious onscreen relationships. Their cheeky flirts and witty banter are what makes this couple so endearing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The feedback that I’ve had from people that have watched the show and have enjoyed the show, talk about the joy that has brought them during this time</a>,” she told Access Hollywood. “I don’t know if this will ever happen again in my career, but I felt the same way making it.</p><h2 id=phil-dunster-1-to-5-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Phil Dunster: $1 to $5 Million</span></h2><p>Phil Dunster plays the epic football player Jamie Tartt, whose ego isolated him from the team. He's made a name for himself as an actor in the U.K. Dunster also starred in the productions The Trouble with Maggie Cole, Humans, Save Me, and Strike Back. Phil Dunster is also a recurring guest in Hulu's Catherine the Great.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Close Is Jason Sudeikis To His Ex Wife, Olivia Wilde?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nick-mohammed-1-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nick Mohammed: $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Nick is a British actor, comedian, and writer who has appeared in numerous sitcoms including Ted Lasso. He has also been in the films Christopher Robin, The Martian, and Bridget Jones's Baby and television shows like Intelligence, Drifters, and Sorry, I've Got No Head.

He is a co-creator and star of the Apple TV+ sitcom. Coach Beard is a man of few words, but he is Ted's right-hand man and so the fans trust him.</p><h2 id=jeremy-swift-4-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jeremy Swift: $4 Million</span></h2><p>Jeremy's career in the acting business has lasted over three decades and is still kicking.

No one could have played Roy Kent other than Brett Goldstein. He delivered one of the most iconic lines from the show to Rebecca, when he stated: "You deserve someone who makes you feel like you’ve been struck by f***ing lightning. Don’t you dare settle for fine."</p><p>He wrote and appeared in the film SuperBob and wrote the Catherine Tate Live Show, and has also performed multiple solo stand-up shows. He was initially just a writer on Ted Lasso and while they were writing the part of Roy, he knew that he could execute it and he was right!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hannah-waddingham-5-5-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Hannah Waddingham: $5.5 Million</span></h2><p>With Waddingham's growing popularity for her character on Ted Lasso, her bank account has followed suit. Hannah portrays the vindictive Rebecca Welton who wanted to destroy her ex-husband's football club... and Ted with it. Her character ends up falling for Ted's charm and unbelievably pure ways and they end up being the best of friends.</p><p>Hannah has an unbelievable singing voice and was actually in musicals before joining television. In 2015, she landed the role of Septa Unella in the HBO drama Game of Thrones. She also starred in Netflix's Sex Education, but Ted Lasso is what put her on the map!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-sudeikis-25-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jason Sudeikis: $25 Million</span></h2><p>In 2003, Sudeikis got his <a href=#>big break on Saturday Night Live</a> as a writer and in 2005 he became a featured performer on the show.

Since then, Sudeikis has been in a number of popular films like We're the Millers, Horrible Bosses, and Hall Pass.</p><p>Sudeikis will receive a lengthy pay raise with a whopping $1 million per episode for his starring role in Ted Lasso. He was initially making about $250,000 to $300,000 per episode so this will definitely increase the actor's current net worth.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Other TV Shows Starring The 'Sons Of Anarchy' Cast</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirnpxdoa60v85mmpqrpGK%2ForrKnptmppWperi70a2fZqKRqLyvedKum56hm57Abq3PqaOeZaSrfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fted-lasso-cast-ranked-net-worth-jason-sudeikis-apple-tv.html&text=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Ted%20Lasso%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fted-lasso-cast-ranked-net-worth-jason-sudeikis-apple-tv.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fted-lasso-cast-ranked-net-worth-jason-sudeikis-apple-tv.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Ted%20Lasso%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fted-lasso-cast-ranked-net-worth-jason-sudeikis-apple-tv.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Ted%20Lasso%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fted-lasso-cast-ranked-net-worth-jason-sudeikis-apple-tv.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Ted%20Lasso%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fted-lasso-cast-ranked-net-worth-jason-sudeikis-apple-tv.html&description=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Ted%20Lasso%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./go-with-the-flow-emote-fortnite.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Go With the Flow Fortnite Emote Comes From This TikTok">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ncis-stars-didnt-know-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stars From NCIS You Didn't Know Died">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
