Here’s how much he’s worth.</strong></p><p>Iconic Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger is considered one of the best action stars in the movie industry’s history. Arnold, who first gained fame as a bodybuilder, quickly transitioned into movies during the 1970s. He first starred in minor roles before being cast in the movie “Stay Hungry,” for which he won a Golden Globe for Best Newcomer in 1976.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to his immense physical strength, Arnold quickly became a leading candidate to be cast in action films. The actor took full advantage of this opportunity starring in movies like “Conan the Barbarian” and its sequel “Conan the Destroyer” in 1982 and 1984, respectively.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/46/04/cd/4604cd28af527d228290d3a1761ef9cd.jpg><p>However, in 1984, Arnold starred in the movie that would become his most famous throughout his career.&nbsp; <a href=#>The actor landed the role of a machine in “Terminator</a>.” He would later reprise his roles in the multiple sequels of the movie. Other action movies that elevated Arnold’s career in the industry include “Commando” in 1985, “Predator” and “The Running Man” in 1987.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor also appeared in “Total Recall” in 1990, “True Lies” in 1994, “Twins” in 1988, and “Kindergarten Cop” in 1990. After a long time off the screen due to his political role, Arnold returned in 2011, starring in “The Expendables.” The actor has continued making various movie appearances since then.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Arnold_Schwarzeneggers_Net_Worth></span><strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Net Worth&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Besides acting, Arnold is also a renowned bodybuilder, politician, model, and businessman. Since he rose to fame, Arnd has consistently been one of the highest-paid actors in the movie industry.&nbsp; During his years at the top of the Hollywood chain, Arnold reportedly earned about $20-30 million per movie.&nbsp;</p><p>His movie career earnings totaled hundreds of millions; however, the actor doesn’t sit on that alone. Arnold also invested some of his money into real estate, and his portfolio is reportedly worth $100 million. However, <a href=#>according to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s net worth is a whopping $450 million.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Arnolds_Movies_Have_Grossed_Over_4_billion></span><strong>Arnold’s Movies Have Grossed Over $4 billion&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arnold’s extensive movie career is what most Hollywood actors aspire to achieve. The Austrian-born actor is regarded as one of Hollywood’s most successful box-office stars. With multiple iconic movie roles and movies, Arnold’s films <a href=#>reportedly grossed over $4 billion.&nbsp;</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The actor is also ranked among the top 40 highest-grossing actors of all time in the industry. Arnold’s <a href=#>various movie roles</a> made him stand out during his peak years in the industry. Despite his huge physical attributes, the actor often performed well in other genres like comedy. His amazing range made him suited to play other roles besides action.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Arnold_Has_Won_the_Mr_Universe_Title_Multiple_Times></span><strong>Arnold Has Won the Mr. Universe Title Multiple Times&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before his advent into the movie industry, Arnold Schwarzenegger was a renowned bodybuilder and incredibly successful at his craft. His meteoritic rise in bodybuilding started in the 1970s when he won successive Mr. Olympia titles.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/df/c8/e2/dfc8e2e6d1959ee1e4209a3d2918f190.jpg><p>However, Arnold’s success at the event didn’t come on a platter. After winning the Junior Mr. Europe title in 1965 at 18, Arnold competed at the NABBA Mr. Universe amateur competition in 1966. Sadly, Arnold came second, losing the title to American bodybuilder Chet Yorton.&nbsp;</p><p>Arnold wouldn’t give up on his dreams, and he competed again the following year, winning his first amateur Mr. Universe Title. A year later, Arnold won the NABBA Mr. Universe professional title. Afterward, he competed at more advanced tournaments like Mr. Olympia but fell short.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after much hard work and dedication,<a href=#> Arnold won the Mr. Universe Professional competition in London in 1970</a>. At the event, Arnold defeated his idol Reg Park to claim the mantle.&nbsp;Subsequently, the bodybuilder went on to win the professional Mr. Olympia title in 1970. At the time, he became the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at 23. He would then continue the winning run and win the title five more times from 1971 to 1975.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Arnold_is_the_Only_Second_Foreign-Born_Governor_of_California></span><strong>Arnold is the Only Second Foreign-Born Governor of California&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Arnold Schwarzenegger <a href=#>was elected Governor of California state</a> on October 7, 2003, they became the second foreign-born governor of the state. Despite his inexperience in politics, Arnold defeated all his other opponents to become the successor of Gray Davis.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor and bodybuilder was one of 135 candidates on the ballot, and he managed to come out on top. The achievement completed an arc for the Austin-born actor who entered the US with nothing but had then become the governor&nbsp;of the most populous state in America. He would go on to win re-election and remain Governor of California for another term.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKmt02agrGWRp7uwuMNmqpygp5a%2Fu7HNnp6gnaKoeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-arnold-schwarzeneggers-net-worth.html&text=What%20Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Four%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20the%20Actor&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-arnold-schwarzeneggers-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-arnold-schwarzeneggers-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Four%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20the%20Actor" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-arnold-schwarzeneggers-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Four%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20the%20Actor" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-arnold-schwarzeneggers-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Four%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20the%20Actor" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-arnold-schwarzeneggers-net-worth.html&description=What%20Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Four%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20the%20Actor" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./yardley-evans-brunt-age-birthday-school-megyn-kelly-and-douglas-brunt-daughter-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yardley Evans Brunt Age, Birthday, School (Megyn Kelly and Douglas Brunt Daughter) Height">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./viviane-araujo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Viviane Araujo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
