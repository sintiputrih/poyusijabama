Some tracks are subject to closures due to significant weather events in the first half of 2023, and as a response to kauri dieback disease. Check the <a href=#>Auckland Council website</a> before you set off to help you plan your route. And always remember, the Waitākere Ranges are a protected area, so please stick to the marked trails and <a href=#>respect the environment</a>.

One of Parnell’s key attractions is the Parnell Rose Gardens, also known as the Dove-Myer Robinson Park. If you’re a fan of flowers, you’ll love the more than 5000 roses that bloom here. The best time to visit is in November during the annual Parnell Festival of Roses when the garden is in full bloom.</p><p>The <a href=#>garden </a>also provides fantastic views of the Waitematā Harbour, making it a great place for a picnic or just to unwind.

You can get to the summit with a moderate 15-minute walk, and the path is well maintained, so it’s doable for most fitness levels. It’s also suitable for wheelchairs and buggies. Once you reach the top, you’ll be rewarded with a panorama of Auckland and its surrounding suburbs, as well as the Waitematā Harbour.</p><p>It’s a great spot for taking pictures, so don’t forget your camera. The summit is also home to a well-preserved volcanic crater that’s more than 50 metres deep. It’s a reminder of<a href=#> Auckland’s volcanic history</a> and definitely something unique to see. While Mt Eden is primarily known for its scenery, there’s also a lot of history here. It’s a significant site for Māori, and you can learn more about its <a href=#>cultural importance</a> through the interpretive signs around the mountain.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Goat Island</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/NwQxWPPMXuEz8uw12Z_HECUrCVw=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/5MXTAO2SIBBIZJ3UAASZN6ECFE.jpg"><p><a href=#>Goat Island</a>, officially known as Te Hāwere-a-Maki Island, is a popular destination north of Auckland’s CBD, especially for those who love <a href=#>marine </a>life.

The island’s crystal-clear waters are a bustling underwater city of diverse fish species, dancing kelp forests, and craggy reefs. You might even see stingrays, snappers, and crayfish. If you prefer to stay dry, there’s a glass-bottom boat tour that lets you see the underwater world.</p><p>Aside from marine life, the island itself is worth exploring. It’s uninhabited and offers a nice walk with views of the surrounding ocean. Just keep in mind that there are no facilities or shops on the island, so pack everything you need for the day. Getting to Goat Island is easy. It’s about <a href=#>an hour’s drive</a> from central Auckland, and there’s plenty of parking near the beach.

They’re free to access, easy to navigate, and offer breathtaking sights.</p><p>A popular option is Tāmaki Drive, which winds its way along the waterfront from downtown Auckland to St Heliers. You’ll pass by <a href=#>several beaches</a> along the way, including Mission Bay and Kohimarama, both great destinations for a swim or a picnic. Plus, the views of <a href=#>Rangitoto Island</a> from the path are pretty amazing.</p><p>If you’re on the North Shore, try the walk from <a href=#>Takapuna Beach</a> to <a href=#>Milford</a>. It’s a bit more of a hike, but the breathtaking coastal sights are worth it. The track takes you along golden sandy beaches, past impressive beach houses, and through native bush. If you’re in need of a pitstop, Takapuna and Milford are both brimming with cafés and shops.</p><p>Just remember to wear comfortable shoes, bring some water, and don’t forget your sunblock.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Cornwall Park and One Tree Hill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/muyXcx8SC5oMjwwG71yWMrsLSF4=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/C5YHWPBHLZYX6QCHLSQKHXQ5NE.jpg"><p>Cornwall Park and<a href=#> One Tree Hill </a>form one of Auckland’s largest and most popular green spaces.

The memorial building at the site houses a commemorative plaque and an exhibition on Savage’s life and work. What makes this park a must-visit, though, is its location.
