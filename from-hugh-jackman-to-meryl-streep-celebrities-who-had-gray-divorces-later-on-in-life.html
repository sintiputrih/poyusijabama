They hit it off instantly and tied the knot within the year, quickly becoming one of Hollywood’s most beloved couples. Upon announcing their divorce in 2023, in a<a href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;statement to PEOPLE</a>, the couple wrote, “We have been blessed to share almost three decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage. Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.” The Wolverine star and Shame actress share two kids together, Oscar and Ava.</p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>2</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/9</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fcf2b91a0ce8-kevin-cosner-wife-christine-baumgartner.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner</h2><p dir=ltr>In May 2023,<a href=#>&nbsp;Kevin Costner’s</a> designer second wife filed for divorce after 18 years together. The couple met while the actor was filming his 1996 rom com , but their romantic connection didn’t blossom until 1998 after he divorced his first wife and welcomed a child with Bridget Rooney. They married in 2004 and have three kids together: Cayden, Hayes, and Grace. Their separation was not all smooth sailing; after rocky legal proceedings where the couple fought over child support payments and their prenup, they finalised their divorce in February 2024.</p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>3</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/9</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f3f35265ea64-meryl-streep-don-gummer.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Meryl Streep and Don Gummer</h2><p dir=ltr><a href=#>The Devil Wears Prada&nbsp;actress</a> and her sculptor hubby<a href=#>&nbsp;have been married</a> for a whopping 45 years and have four kids together: Henry Wolf, Mamie Gummer, Grace Gummer and Louisa Jacobson.

Just two years after their divorce, Caitlyn made headlines when she publicly<a href=#>&nbsp;came out as transgender</a> in an interview with Diane Sawyer, a revelation which the Kardashians claimed they had no knowledge of. Tensions escalated between Caitlyn and the Kardashian clan since releasing her<a href=#>&nbsp;tell-all book</a> in 2017, The Secrets of My Life, in which she claimed that Kris knew all along about her gender dysphoria: “She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn…I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did because I did it several times in front of her after we were married.”</p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>5</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/9</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27746354a7ff-gettyimages-79106267.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Billy Ray and Tish Cyrus</h2><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Miley</a> and<a href=#>&nbsp;Noah’s</a> parents were married for an incredible 29 years before the curtains closed on their marriage in April 2022.

Their marriage had been rocky for a while preceding their split; Billy Ray filed for divorce in 2010, only to change his mind and rescind it. Then came<a href=#>&nbsp;Tish’s turn to file</a> in 2013, but the husband and wife reconciled after extensive couple’s therapy.

The pair met when Melinda worked for Microsoft as a product manager under Bill, who was, of course, the CEO. Their professional admiration for each other blossomed into romance, and they married in 1994. They started their charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in 2000, dedicated to eliminating global inequality, championing public health and improving education across the US. Their incredible work even earned them the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. Following their divorce, Melinda received $12.5 billion and recently announced that she will donate $1 billion of this fortune over two years to organisations championing women’s rights.<br></p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>7</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/9</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/47c0ec7a5b66-danny-devito-rhea-perlman.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Rhea Pearlman and Danny DeVito</h2><p dir=ltr>The<a href=#>&nbsp;two actors</a> have had a long and often tumultuous marriage, meeting in 1971 after Rhea saw Danny star in a play and was immediately smitten.

Their on-screen chemistry was just as compelling as their off-screen love; the pair starred opposite each other in Roald Dahl’s&nbsp;&nbsp;and the classic TV show ‘Taxi’. Their marriage had its fair share of challenges; they separated in 2012 only to reconcile just six months later, before officially separating for good in 2017.

While the reason for their separation remains shrouded in mystery, there is some speculation that infidelity was the cause.

He had<a href=#>&nbsp;fathered a child</a> with their housekeeper in 1997 and finally admitted to his indiscretion when the boy was 14 years old, prompting Maria to leave him. Despite the circumstances of their separation, the pair<a href=#>&nbsp;remain on good terms</a> and are frequently seen together for their kids’ birthdays, weddings and graduations, putting up a united front. In an interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Arnold reflected, “If there's Oscars for how to handle divorce, Maria and I should get it for having the least amount of impact on the kids.”</p><p id=epXuaZU3g8l></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8d4OWcGlpZ5anvK55x66eoWWalrCsucCnZK2nXaKys8XLZqqtqpWavW6vxKWcm6qZqbamv4ywn6hlmJaxbrPRmrBmnJmrvLOvxKxkpZmkmr9uu81moKdlnJ6zpns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffrom-hugh-jackman-to-meryl-streep-celebrities-who-had-gray-divorces-later-on-in-life.html&text=From%20Hugh%20Jackman%20to%20Meryl%20Streep%3a%20celebrities%20who%20had%20gray%20divorces%20later%20on%20in%20life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrom-hugh-jackman-to-meryl-streep-celebrities-who-had-gray-divorces-later-on-in-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrom-hugh-jackman-to-meryl-streep-celebrities-who-had-gray-divorces-later-on-in-life.html&title=From%20Hugh%20Jackman%20to%20Meryl%20Streep%3a%20celebrities%20who%20had%20gray%20divorces%20later%20on%20in%20life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffrom-hugh-jackman-to-meryl-streep-celebrities-who-had-gray-divorces-later-on-in-life.html&title=From%20Hugh%20Jackman%20to%20Meryl%20Streep%3a%20celebrities%20who%20had%20gray%20divorces%20later%20on%20in%20life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffrom-hugh-jackman-to-meryl-streep-celebrities-who-had-gray-divorces-later-on-in-life.html&title=From%20Hugh%20Jackman%20to%20Meryl%20Streep%3a%20celebrities%20who%20had%20gray%20divorces%20later%20on%20in%20life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrom-hugh-jackman-to-meryl-streep-celebrities-who-had-gray-divorces-later-on-in-life.html&description=From%20Hugh%20Jackman%20to%20Meryl%20Streep%3a%20celebrities%20who%20had%20gray%20divorces%20later%20on%20in%20life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./monta-ellis-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Monta Ellis Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./xfx-type-01-bravo-case-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Final Words - XFX Type 01 Bravo Case Review">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
