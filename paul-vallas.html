Vallas claimed that the Chicago Public Schools were healthier under his leadership than then were in 2019. PolitiFact rated this claim as "mostly true".</p><p>In March 2018, Vallas announced his candidacy for Mayor of Chicago in the 2019 election.</p><p>In March 2018, Vallas formally filed to become a candidate in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election.</p><p>In 2013, Vallas became Superintendent of the Bridgeport Public Schools. On June 28, 2013, a state superior court judge ruled that Vallas did not complete a state-mandated school leadership program and was therefore not qualified to be superintendent in Connecticut. On July 17, 2013 the State Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling and to decide if he should remain in office. This followed several months of controversy over Vallas' credentials to serve as superintendent in the state of Connecticut.</p><p>In November 2013, Illinois Governor <a href=#>Pat Quinn</a> tapped Vallas to be his running mate in the 2014 election, after incumbent lieutenant governor <a href=#>Sheila Simon</a> chose to unsuccessfully run for Comptroller. Quinn and Vallas lost the election to the Republican ticket of <a href=#>Bruce Rauner</a> and <a href=#>Evelyn Sanguinetti</a>.</p><p>Among the numerous candidates to enter the race after Emanuel withdrew was <a href=#>Gery Chico</a>, Vallas' one-time political ally, with whom he oversaw Chicago Public Schools. Vallas had endorsed Chico for mayor in 2011. Despite this history, Vallas did not hesitate to criticize Chico as a mayoral opponent.</p><p>After Haiti's 2010 earthquake, President RenÃ© PrÃ©val gave the Inter-American Development Bank the mandate to work with the Education Ministry and the National Commission preparing a major reform of the Education System in a 5-year plan to reconstruct; Mr. Vallas has been working with the bank in this effort.</p><p>On June 11, 2009, Vallas announced that he would not be a candidate for President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 2010. Vallas stated that he could not "begin a political campaign while trying to finish what he startedâ€”rebuild the school system there in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina."</p><p>On April 28, 2008 he appeared before the City Club of Chicago and on Chicago news shows discussing a possible run for governor in 2010. In February 2009, Vallas gave an interview to Carol Marin in the Chicago Sun-Times and stated that he planned to return to Cook County, Illinois in 2009 and run as a Republican for Cook County Board president in 2010.</p><p>In 2005, Vallas considered challenging Blagojevich again for Illinois governor in the Democratic Primary but decided against it. He then signed a two-year contract (2007â€“2008) as superintendent of the Recovery School District of Louisiana. Vallas ultimately remained head of the Recovery School District through 2011.</p><p>Following the election, Vallas was appointed CEO of School District of Philadelphia. In this capacity, he presided over the nation's largest experiment in privatized management of schools, with the management of over 40 schools turned over to outside for-profits, nonprofits, and universities beginning in Fall 2002.</p><p>During his tenure as CEO of the Chicago Public Schools from 1995 to 2001, he led an effort to reform the school system, and his work was cited by President Bill Clinton for raising test scores, balancing the budget, and instituting several new programs including mandatory summer school, after school programs, and expanding alternative, charter, and magnet schools.</p><p>Vallas' campaign sent unsolicited text messages. The campaign employed North Carolina-based firm Link2Tek to accomplish this. In mid-January, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Vallas campaign, alleging that it had violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, which prohibits calling or texting a person using an automatic telephone dialing system without their consent. Vallas accused the lawsuit of being, "a dirty trick" orchestrated by the "political machine".</p><p>Paul Gust Vallas (born June 10, 1953) is an American politician and former superintendent of the Bridgeport Public Schools and the Recovery School District of Louisiana, former CEO of both the School District of Philadelphia and the Chicago Public Schools, and a former budget director for the city of Chicago. He ran for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 2014 with then-incumbent Governor <a href=#>Pat Quinn</a>, though the Democratic ticket was defeated by the Republican ticket, which included <a href=#>Bruce Rauner</a> and <a href=#>Evelyn Sanguinetti</a>.</p><p>Vallas was born on June 10, 1953. The grandson of Greek immigrants, Vallas grew up in the Roseland neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. He spent his teen years living in Palos Heights. He graduated from Carl Sandburg High School and attended Moraine Valley Community College and then Western Illinois University, where he received a bachelor's degree in history and political science, a master's degree in political science, and a teaching certificate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfpa62uIyvmKWkkag%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpaul-vallas.html&text=Paul%20Vallas%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaul-vallas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-vallas.html&title=Paul%20Vallas%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpaul-vallas.html&title=Paul%20Vallas%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-vallas.html&title=Paul%20Vallas%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaul-vallas.html&description=Paul%20Vallas%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./will-a-bad-purge-valve-cause-bad-gas-mileage-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will a bad purge valve cause bad gas mileage?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./olivia-holzmacher.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Olivia Holzmacher - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
