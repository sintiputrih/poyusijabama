The tour featuring music from Swift’s entire discography was the starting point of their romance, as Kelce publicly announced his crush on Swift after attending one of her <a href=#>July 2023 shows</a> in Kansas City.</p><p>News of the pair’s relationship broke in September 2023 when Swift attended her <a href=#>first Kansas City Chiefs game</a>, but she later revealed that she and Kelce <a href=#>began dating</a> not long after her Missouri tour stop.</p><p>“We actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other,” she shared in her December 2023 <a href=# rel=noopener>TIME</a> Person of the Year cover story. “By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”</p><p>In February 2024, a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that Kelce would be “joining Taylor on her tour and traveling with her” following <a href=#>Super Bowl LVIII</a>. “They are happy and looking forward to spending more time together,” the insider added. (The Chiefs ultimately <a href=#>defeated</a> the San Francisco 49ers for their second consecutive Super Bowl win.)</p><p>Scroll down to see all the time Kelce attended Swift’s The Eras Tour:</p><h3>July 2023</h3><p>Before the pair sparked a romance, Kelce attempted to get Swift’s attention by giving her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it at her Kansas City Eras Tour show. “Well, I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” he shared on an episode of his and brother <strong>Jason Kelce</strong>’s <a href=# rel=noopener>“New Heights” podcast</a> at the time.</p><p>Travis continued: “So, I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her. … She doesn’t meet anybody — or at least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal. But it was an unbelievable show.”</p><p>Swift told TIME in December 2023 that she “started hanging out” with Travis after he “very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Every-Time-Travis-Kelce-Supported-Taylor-Swift-at-Her-Eras-Tour-Concerts-568.jpg><h3>November 2023</h3><p>Two months after their relationship went public, Travis used a break in his football schedule to <a href=#>travel to Buenos Aires</a> for his second Eras Tour concert. During the show’s finale, Swift surprised the tight end and fans by <a href=#>changing the lyrics</a> to her finale song, “Karma,” from “guy on the screen,” which was a reference to her ex-boyfriend <strong>Joe Alwyn</strong>, to “guy on the Chiefs.”</p><p>Fans captured Travis’ reaction to the lyrics shout-out via <a href=# rel=noopener>social media</a>. Taylor’s dad, <strong>Scott Swift</strong>, gave Travis a playful shove before he covered his face with his hands and blushed. The couple were also filmed sharing a passionate kiss backstage after the show.</p><p>Travis opened up about his Argentina Eras Tour experience on the “New Heights” podcast not long after. Though he admitted to having “a little bit of a clue” about the “Karma” lyric change, Travis said it “shocked” him nonetheless. “I was like, ‘Oh … she really just said that.’”</p><p>He went on to apologize for leaving Scott hanging as he tried to give him a high-five during the finale song. “Mr. Swift, I apologize, big guy,” Travis stated. “I never miss a high-five, too, big high-five guy. It’s the most electric thing you could do at an event.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I-Had-a-Date-Hoda-Kotb-574.jpg><h3>February 2024</h3><p>Travis followed up the Chiefs’ Super Bowl LVIII victory by heading to Sydney for the second leg of Swift’s Australia Eras Tour shows. While attending the first of her four nights at Accor Stadium, Travis sported <a href=#>several friendship bracelets</a> while hanging out in a VIP tent with fellow celebrity attendees <strong>Rita Ora</strong>, <strong>Taika Waititi</strong> and <strong>Katy Perry</strong>. He was also seen walking around <a href=#>handing out guitar picks</a> to fans with his friend and fellow football player, <strong>Ross Travis</strong>.</p><p>Taylor, for her part, gave her boyfriend <a href=#>several sweet nods</a> during the performance. In addition to repeating her “Karma” lyric change, she pointed to Travis while singing the “Willow” lyric “That’s my man” and the “Long Live” line “When they gave us our trophies.” The later shout-out seemingly was a reference to both Travis’ Super Bowl victory and her <a href=#>Grammy Awards wins</a> earlier that month. Just like Argentina, the pair were seen sharing another <a href=#>backstage embrace and kiss</a>.</p><p>“Taylor’s very fond of performing in Australia because of the crowds over there and how into it they get,” Travis recalled of his time Down Under on the <a href=# rel=noopener>“New Heights” podcast</a>. “Shout-out to Australia for showing up, showing out.”</p><h3>March 2024</h3><p>Travis was spotted jamming out at one of <a href=#>Taylor’s shows in Singapore </a>on March 8, where she changed the “Karma” lyric once again. After Taylor gave her shout-out to the “guy on the Chiefs,” she ran off stage and into Travis’ arms for a kiss. The next night, Travis was <a href=#><span class=s1>spotted in the crowd </span></a>again.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>April 2024</h3><p>Travis traveled to Swift’s Eras Tour concert in Paris as she <a href=#>celebrated her 87th show</a> — which is his NFL jersey number. Swift blew a <a href=#>number of kisses</a> in Kelce’s direction during the performance, and he was seen supporting her from the audience by filming her and dancing along to her tracks.</p><h3>June 2024</h3><p>Travis attended three of Swift’s Eras Tour shows at London’s Wembley Stadium and even surprised fans by <a href=#>making an appearance on stage</a>. During Swift’s Tortured Poets Department set, Travis joined dancers <strong>Kam Saunders </strong>and<strong> Jan Ravnik</strong> in a matching morning suit and top hat. He picked up Swift and carried her across the stage, did a special jig and applied pretend blush on both of their faces.</p><p>One week later, Travis seemingly surprised Swift by showing up at her third concert in Dublin after attending the wedding of Chiefs running back <strong>Clyde Edwards-Helaire</strong>. He was <a href=#>spotted in the VIP tent</a> with <strong>Julia Roberts</strong> and <strong>Stevie Nicks</strong> before leaving Aviva Stadium with Swift.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaerpWnxm7AyKacZqyilsOqv4yknKWblWKutcDEp5uenF2prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8G0ecSrmKxlpKTCs3nSoaawq18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevery-time-travis-kelce-attended-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-shows.html&text=Every%20Time%20Travis%20Kelce%20Attended%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20%27Eras%20Tour%27%20Shows&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-time-travis-kelce-attended-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-shows.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-time-travis-kelce-attended-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-shows.html&title=Every%20Time%20Travis%20Kelce%20Attended%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20%27Eras%20Tour%27%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevery-time-travis-kelce-attended-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-shows.html&title=Every%20Time%20Travis%20Kelce%20Attended%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20%27Eras%20Tour%27%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevery-time-travis-kelce-attended-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-shows.html&title=Every%20Time%20Travis%20Kelce%20Attended%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20%27Eras%20Tour%27%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-time-travis-kelce-attended-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-shows.html&description=Every%20Time%20Travis%20Kelce%20Attended%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20%27Eras%20Tour%27%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./google-releases-43-ota-for-htc-one-and-galaxy-s4-google-play-editions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Google Releases 4.3 OTA for HTC One and Galaxy S4 Google Play Editions">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./american-gigolo-was-canceled-on-showtime-after-its-first-season.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="American Gigolo Was Canceled On Showtime After Its First Season">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
