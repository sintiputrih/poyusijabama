I got my feelings hurt, but you can’t help it,” the Florida-based boat mechanic tells <i>Us Weekly</i>. “You’re sleeping, working and strategizing side by side. So when one of your very good friends turns on you, it’s totally unnecessary. We could have voted somebody else out and just had a conversation. But that’s not what happens in <i>Survivor</i>. You don’t get a second chance. You get one chance to be a schmuck and that’s what I did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>While on the island, he clashed with some of his tribemates, including <b>Ken McNickle</b>. The model, 33, often called Wachter out for saying he would do a task and then not following through with it.</p><p>“Ken was on the bottom and he knew it,” admits Wachter. “He was pretty much going to say anything he had to to stay. There’s a reason the six of us were together and he was on the outs with <b>David</b> [<b>Wright</b>] and <b>CeCe</b> [<b>Taylor</b>]. Ken had his opportunity to be in the alliance many times. For some reason, he didn’t want to get involved.”</p><p>When it came down to it, Wachter and McNickle just couldn’t relate to each other. “We come from different worlds. He’s in a zen world and I’m in a right now, today world. He’s a tough guy to figure out,” Wachter says. “I don’t stand on the edge of the rock with a sun beaming behind me. That’s Ken’s job. He models.”</p><p>The rock singer shares more with <i>Us</i>.</p><p><b>Us Weekly: As the oldest player in the game, did you feel pressure to be the tribe’s leader?</b></p><p><b>Paul Wachter</b>: No, you see people calling me the alpha male, but we had six of us that were type-A personalities. My personality is large, so people construe that as being a boss, but sometimes it bites you in the butt.</p><p><b>Us: Did stepping up hurt your game?</b></p><p><b>PW</b>: No question about it. One of the things you shouldn’t do in <i>Survivor</i> is be the candle. You don’t want to be the flame. I was the flamethrower. Coming in as a leader is something I can’t change. It’s who I am. Other than not knowing when to shut up, because sometimes I should shut up, I don’t know if I could have done it differently. It’s hard to change your personality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Us: You sat down with some of the millennials over lunch. What was your impression of them after talking to them?</b></p><p><b>PW</b>: They’re great! They were anxious to ask me a million questions. I’m the old guy and they haven’t talked to a parent in a long time. They were like, “How do we sharpen our machete?” They’ve also gone through the same things as us. They had to be evacuated. They told me, “<a href=#>Right before we were evacuated</a>, we were having a beach party instead of building our shelter!” [<i>Laughs</i>] They’re just kids. One of my biggest regrets was that I didn’t make it to the merge where I could hang out with the kids. I thought I could have aligned with them.</p><p><b><a href=#>Us: What was your reaction when Taylor [Stocker] and Figgy [Jessica Figueroa] told you about their relationship</a>?</b></p><p><b>PW</b>: First thing we were told about was the showmance. <a href=#>I’ve never heard it called a showmance</a>! It just shows you how old I am. [<i>Laughs</i>.] <i>Survivor</i> is challenging, fun, intriguing, but bottom line, you’re playing for a million dollars. They could have waited 39 days.</p><p><b>Us: In the immunity challenge, CeCe insisted on crossing the beam herself because she wanted to get her own work done. Do you think that Gen X mentality lost you the challenge?</b></p><p><b>PW</b>: Come hell or high water, she was going to finish the challenge. Unfortunately, that was an individual decision and not a tribe decision. And she was in a tribe. She’s glad she did it even though it cost us the challenge.</p><p><b>Us: You told Jessica that, if it came up, you would form an all-boys alliance. Do you regret that move?</b></p><p><b>PW</b>: Obviously it was a mistake because it cost me the game. It came across like I had said, “Hey, I’ll cut you girls out in a minute.” It’s what I said but it’s not what I meant. I thought it was way too early to be playing that worry game. We had a great six-person alliance. It seemed very simple to me. But I was wrong.</p><p><b>Us: Did you have any inkling that you were on the chopping block?</b></p><p><b>PW</b>: No, no clue at all, because the guys had assured me over and over, ’cause they were convinced that the six of us were staying together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Us: You were also the first castaway that needed medical assistance. Walk us through what happened when you collapsed and Dr. Joe said you may have had symptoms of a heart attack.</b></p><p>PW: Everybody was feeling weak. We had been through a lot. <a href=#>We had been evacuated,</a> been through a full day and night of torrential rain and had rebuilt our camp twice. I got really dehydrated. Everything happened very quickly. I knew they wouldn’t let me die out there, but I knew I was in trouble. They had the medical team there immediately. They gave me electrolytes and what I needed to get me back on my feet. The next day, I was like Superman.</p><p><b>Us: Who is the biggest threat in the game?</b></p><p><b>PW</b>: I’ll give you two. I think the biggest sleeper is David, and I think the biggest threat is Chris. David comes across as, “Oh, poor me!” and Chris has a very quiet confidence about him. You feel very comfortable with that guy. He’s very calculated in what he says and he’s a smart guy. He’s a good friend of mine.</p><p><b>Us: In the end, do you think a millennial or a Gen Xer will win?</b></p><p><b>PW</b>: Gen X is going to win it. I just don’t think a millennial has what it takes to go all the way to the end. If I had to put my money on it, I think Chris and David have it.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X <i>airs on CBS Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKquqqaew7C%2B0manmq2cYsSir8etnKtlo5bGtHnGmqSeZZ2WsaZ5x6KkZpldqLCpudScomavZGmAeH6VaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsurvivors-paul-wachter-says-game-made-him-a-schmuck-w443726.html&text=Survivors%20Paul%20Wachter%20Says%20Game%20Made%20Him%20a%20Schmuck&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsurvivors-paul-wachter-says-game-made-him-a-schmuck-w443726.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsurvivors-paul-wachter-says-game-made-him-a-schmuck-w443726.html&title=Survivors%20Paul%20Wachter%20Says%20Game%20Made%20Him%20a%20Schmuck" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsurvivors-paul-wachter-says-game-made-him-a-schmuck-w443726.html&title=Survivors%20Paul%20Wachter%20Says%20Game%20Made%20Him%20a%20Schmuck" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsurvivors-paul-wachter-says-game-made-him-a-schmuck-w443726.html&title=Survivors%20Paul%20Wachter%20Says%20Game%20Made%20Him%20a%20Schmuck" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsurvivors-paul-wachter-says-game-made-him-a-schmuck-w443726.html&description=Survivors%20Paul%20Wachter%20Says%20Game%20Made%20Him%20a%20Schmuck" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./a-budget-home-theater-pc-setup-4k-hdr-uhd-bluray-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Evaluating Display Sources: HTPCs &amp;amp; CE Devices">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./oklahoma-mom-of-3-killed-airplane-wing-while-riding-lawn-mower-airport-8303282.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mom of 3 Killed by Airplane Wing While Riding Lawn Mower">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
