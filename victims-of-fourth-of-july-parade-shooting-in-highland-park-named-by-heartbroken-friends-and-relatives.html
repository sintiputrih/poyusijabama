Josefina said one of her nieces’ boyfriends was also one of the dozens injured in the attack—he was in a stable condition on Monday but was facing surgery to remove a bullet from near his lungs. “There isn’t a safe place anymore,” Josefina added.</p><p>It appears they weren’t the only family in which multiple relatives were shot. Sharing a link to a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>medical bill fundraiser</a> on Tuesday morning, the Chicago Teachers Union said William Dever Elementary School teacher Zoe Kolpack and her husband, named elsewhere as Stephen Kolpack, were wounded in the attack. “They were with their two children, who were unharmed,” the tweet read. The fundraiser’s creator, who called Zoe her “best friend,” added that the teacher’s father and brother-in-law were also hit. “They are all in the hospital undergoing various surgeries, which will seriously impact these families financially,” the fundraiser description reads. “I do not want this to be another burden on them as they will have many obstacles to go through in the months ahead.”</p><p>As well as Sundheim and Toledo, four other deceased are yet to be identified. Doctors who treated the dozens of wounded people at local hospitals said the victims ranged in age between 8 and 85. David Baum, a local physician who attended the parade with his family, saw some of the devastating wounds firsthand when the shooting stopped.</p><p>“I saw horrific, devastating injuries, the kind that you normally see in a war,” Baum <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>told The Daily Beast</a> on Monday, adding that the bodies of those killed “were literally blown up by those bullets.”</p><p>Local law enforcement detained 22-year-old <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Robert “Bobby” Crimo</a> around seven hours after the carnage began, calling him a person of interest in connection with the shooting. Disturbing videos posted on the Illinois local’s social-media channels—where Crimo used the alias Awake the Rapper—are riddled with violent images and mass-shooting fantasy, including an animation in which a gunman is killed by cops.</p><p><a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>NBC 5</a> reports that Crimo was identified by authorities thanks to a rapid trace by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms using DNA collected from a rifle found at the scene of the attack. The outlet also claims that, at some point on the day of the shooting, Crimo was dressed as a woman, though it wasn’t clear if this was still the case when he was taken into custody.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpp6wtbXMrGSonl2bvLa%2B06FkqJ5dn8KtxYypmKuZlJp6tLTOqKuippditq95x6KeoaSRo7FuvMCromamkaKypXnBsmShnZGnwaO%2BzqScp2WWp7amusOsZJqmlGK%2FprjAraCvnaNk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvictims-of-fourth-of-july-parade-shooting-in-highland-park-named-by-heartbroken-friends-and-relatives.html&text=Victims%20of%20Fourth%20of%20July%20Parade%20Shooting%20in%20Highland%20Park%20Named%20by%20Heartbroken%20Friends%20and%20Relative&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvictims-of-fourth-of-july-parade-shooting-in-highland-park-named-by-heartbroken-friends-and-relatives.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvictims-of-fourth-of-july-parade-shooting-in-highland-park-named-by-heartbroken-friends-and-relatives.html&title=Victims%20of%20Fourth%20of%20July%20Parade%20Shooting%20in%20Highland%20Park%20Named%20by%20Heartbroken%20Friends%20and%20Relative" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvictims-of-fourth-of-july-parade-shooting-in-highland-park-named-by-heartbroken-friends-and-relatives.html&title=Victims%20of%20Fourth%20of%20July%20Parade%20Shooting%20in%20Highland%20Park%20Named%20by%20Heartbroken%20Friends%20and%20Relative" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvictims-of-fourth-of-july-parade-shooting-in-highland-park-named-by-heartbroken-friends-and-relatives.html&title=Victims%20of%20Fourth%20of%20July%20Parade%20Shooting%20in%20Highland%20Park%20Named%20by%20Heartbroken%20Friends%20and%20Relative" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvictims-of-fourth-of-july-parade-shooting-in-highland-park-named-by-heartbroken-friends-and-relatives.html&description=Victims%20of%20Fourth%20of%20July%20Parade%20Shooting%20in%20Highland%20Park%20Named%20by%20Heartbroken%20Friends%20and%20Relative" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-liz-cambage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to Liz Cambage?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./suro-solar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-676799-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suro Solar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
