Her daughters, Raz and Aviv, were beside her and her mother, Efrat Katz. In this sanctuary, the tranquility was shattered as Hamas terrorists breached the border, launching an attack on the border cities and villages of Israel.</p><p>This ruthless Islamic terror group not only targeted police stations, military outposts, and security forces but also unleashed their aggression upon innocent civilians. Shockingly, many civilians were injured, some fatally, and many were captured and forcibly taken to Gaza as hostages.</p><p>When Doron sensed the approaching danger, she acted swiftly, reaching out to her husband, Yoni Asher, desperately alerting him to the imminent threat at her home. She conveyed the terrifying news that armed terrorists were closing in on their residence. Their conversation was tragically brief before the line was abruptly severed.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Doron Asher with her daughters and husband" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Doron-Asher-with-her-daughters-and-husband.webp alt="Doron Asher with her daughters and husband" width=400 height=578 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Yoni attempted to redial but to no avail. Soon after, tracing Doron’s phone revealed its location across the border in Gaza, confirming the grim possibility that she and her daughters had been taken there. Yoni’s worst fears were later substantiated when he came across a distressing video on social media.</p><p>The footage painfully depicted Doron and their precious daughters being held at gunpoint, loaded onto a cart alongside other hostages, and forcibly taken away by heartless Hamas militants. In this desperate moment, Yoni issued an impassioned plea, begging for his family’s safety and even offering himself as a hostage in exchange for their safe return.</p><h2><strong><br><img decoding=async title="Doron Asher brother Ravid Katz" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Doron-Asher-brother-Ravid-Katz.webp alt="Doron Asher brother Ravid Katz" width=400 height=555 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Asher’s Brother is Also Missing</strong></h2><p>While viewing reports of the missing Israeli civilians, we learned that Doron’s brother, Ravid Katz, is also missing. The news was confirmed by Leeor Katz Natanzon, Mrs. Asher’s older sister, who posted an emotional message on her Facebook account confirming that Ravid is also missing. Leeor posted on FB:</p><p>My brother, Rabid Katz We are going crazy with the lack of information about where you are… I envision how bravely you went out to defend the kibbutz… We pray that maybe you are next to Doron and the girls, embracing them.
