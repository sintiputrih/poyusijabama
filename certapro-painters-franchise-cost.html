The size of the territory is carefully determined based on various factors, such as prospective residential clients, paint sales data, consumer buying patterns, and historical sales data. By analyzing these factors, CertaPro ensures that each franchisee has ample market potential within their designated territory.</p><p>The territory is defined by zip codes, providing a clear boundary for franchise operations. This exclusivity ensures that franchisees have the opportunity to establish a strong customer base and brand presence within their area. It also helps to prevent unnecessary competition between franchisees and fosters a collaborative environment for business growth.</p><p>Franchisees are not allowed to serve customers outside their assigned territory without permission from CertaPro. This allows for better control and management of service quality, ensuring that customers receive consistent and reliable painting and decorating services throughout the territory.</p><p>It is important to note that while residential painting and decorating services are limited to exclusive territories, commercial painting and decorating services are not subject to territorial restrictions.
