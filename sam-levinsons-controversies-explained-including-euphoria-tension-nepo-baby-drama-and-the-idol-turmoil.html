While as a culture we’ve mostly moved away from the idea that directors and showrunners have carte blanche to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">abuse their staff to create art</a>, it’s clear not everyone got the memo. But just how loud were the alarms about Levinson’s behavior? And is he just somebody who pushes hard for his vision, or yet another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bully throwing his weight around</a> under the guise of making a show?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-sam-levinson data-injectable=false>Who is Sam Levinson?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sam-Levinson-The-Idol.jpg><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>Sam Levinson is an American-born filmmaker and actor. His father is Barry Levinson, a director who had a slew of hits in the late eighties and early nineties, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Morning, Vietnam</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rain Man</a>, the latter of which won him an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Academy Award</a>.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>The younger Levinson made his acting debut alongside his brother, Jack, in his dad’s film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Toys</a>. His next two acting projects were also directed by his dad. He had one more acting role in the indie flick <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stoic</a> before he switched to writing, directing, and producing full time. His directorial debut, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Another Happy Day</a>, won the Waldo Salt screenwriting award at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sundance</a>.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>His first foray into television writing came in 2017 with TV-movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wizard of Lies</a>, also directed by his dad, but his star really rose in 2019 with the release of Euphoria. He wrote, directed, and produced the U.S version of the scintillating teen drama, which was based off of an Israeli television series of the same name.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What are Sam Levinson’s controversies?</h2><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>While the accolades were piling up for Levinson, especially with regards to Euphoria, there were some more troubling bits of information coming out about the American director at the same time. Here are some of his most infamous controversies.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Getting jobs through daddy</h3><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>While there’s no doubt Levinson has created and directed content that chimes with a wide audience, for successful people in Hollywood there’s no doubt their father’s position help them get a foot in the door (or, in Sam’s case, an entire leg). His first acting and writing roles were all on projects his famous father directed, produced, or both.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Levinson isn’t the first or last person to get a leg up thanks to family connections, and nobody can blame Barry for trying to do the best by his son, but considering Sam’s seemingly troubling behavior (as we’ll detail below), it seems prudent to ask if his inherent power in the industry has contributed to his transgressions and inability to work well with others?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Malcolm and Mary is such an offensive movie. I’ll never get over how obvious Sam Levinson’s jealousy of Barry Jenkins is, his racism & misogyny is blatant at every turn. Sam levinson is a boring nepo baby, a racist & a predator. Fuck Sam levinson all my homies hate Sam Levinson. <a href=#>https://t.co/bOv27RBPUx</a></p>— maybe she born w bars maybe iss trauma~typo king (@WocDonnaTartt) <a href=#>March 1, 2023</a></figure><h3 data-injectable=false>An insistence on writing nude scenes</h3><p data-characters=518 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Nudity is a charged subject, and can be a big deal for performers, especially younger ones. Most would also agree nudity shouldn’t just be done for the sake of titillating an audience, but like everything in a script, should advance the plot or characterization in some way. Insisting on your characters being naked for no real reason doesn’t exactly make someone a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Weinstein</a>, but if it’s combined with other troubling behavior, can paint a picture of someone’s personality. Enter Sam Levinson.</p><p data-characters=705 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Various cast members of Euphoria have discussed how there were numerous times Levinson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote nudity into scenes where it simply wasn’t necessary</a>. Sometimes, he would even do this as a rewrite on the day of shooting, which is troubling in its own right. When on set, actors carry a lot of weight in terms of getting scenes filmed, as taking too long can impact budgets and timings, and possibly even run a show into the ground. Not only that, but if an actor argues with a director about a choice they’ve made, they risk being kicked off the show, a harrowing and scary experience for any professional, let alone the young, usually unconnected performers Levinson was working with on Euphoria.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The way Jules’ special – written by Hunter Schafer herself, who drew on her own emotions and experiences to further develop her character and advance her arc – was entirely ignored in EUPHORIA S2 as Jules’ story was sidelined and rewritten by Sam Levinson will never not enrage me <a href=#>https://t.co/TxJ8SyCzHO</a></p>— Zoë Rose Bryant (@ZoeRoseBryant) <a href=#>March 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>To be fair to Levinson, sex is a huge part of the appeal of Euphoria, and he was always happy to accommodate his cast’s wishes, so this isn’t quite as bad as it might first appear. But rewriting scenes and ambushing performers with nudity still isn’t ideal behavior, even if it’s rowed back on when challenged.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>18-hour workdays and “toxic” conditions</h3><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>Unlike the previous controversies, there’s no real grey area when it comes to how Levinson allegedly treated staff during the filming of season two of Euphoria. As per the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Beast</a>, Levinson often ran 18 hour plus workdays, exacerbated by the director turning up to set without a shot list. Many of the crew complained they weren’t fed on time either, and that there weren’t enough bathrooms on set. There have even been claims that a SAG-AFRA union representative had to show up to ensure basic workplace standards were being followed, although the union has neither confirmed nor denied this.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>Conditions were especially bad for extras, with some sources stating they would hide in the bushes to avoid being called to set thanks to Levinson’s laissez faire attitude to shooting, which often meant actors weren’t aware if they’d be working for 30 minutes or three hours. Add in the fact that shooting often began in the late afternoon and ended at the crack of dawn, and you have a recipe for a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">truly toxic set</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Cutting back Barbie Ferreira’s screen time after an argument</h3><p data-characters=751 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=true>As news of the shambolic way season two of Euphoria was filmed hit the internet, rumors of a feud between Levinson and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie Ferreira</a>, one of the show’s stars, began circulating. Ferreira walked off set after a series of incidents, including one where she hurt herself during a hot tub scene. She was also involved in conversations about the direction of the show where she disagreed with Levinson, which led to the director cutting at least one of her major scenes, something confirmed by sources to the Daily Beast. The fan favorite, who plays Kat Hernandez, has done very little to dispel these stories, giving fluff PR responses when grilled about her relationship with Levinson in various interviews. <a href=#>She is not returning for season three</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The Idol’s grim set</h3><p data-characters=765 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>Narratives about powerful men abusing desperate women have the power to be educational and transformative, yet Hollywood keeps <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring old men to write and direct them</a>, which usually ends up with the camera once again being a fetishistic tool instead of a means to tell a great story. The Idol looked like it might buck the trend when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Seimetz</a> was hired to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">direct the six-episode drama </a>about a Hollywood starlet trying to recapture her fame while falling in with a creepy cult leader, but then she promptly quit the show in April 2022. Levinson, up until that point a writer and producer, stepped in to direct. Nobody explained why she quit, but there are reports <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Weeknd</a> felt the show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had too much of a “female perspective”</a> under her stewardship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>to fire the original director cause it ‘leaned too much into a female perspective’ and waste a $75 million budget just to reshoot everything from the ground up and hire sam levinson to write a torture porn script is just insane. <a href=#>https://t.co/7lzwdSYetC</a></p>— ❦ (@saintdoII) <a href=#>March 1, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true>From there, it’s all been a downward spiral. The show is now late and millions over budget, allegedly because of Levinson’s insistence on rewrites and reshoots. His megalomaniac tendencies were then allowed to fully flourish, allegedly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">enabled happily by the Weeknd</a>, and the supposedly dark satire about 21st century fame ended up becoming what it was supposed to be making fun of.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>“It was like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show,” said one production member. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO</a> has consistently defended the show and money maker Levinson, telling Rolling Stone:</p><p>&nbsp;“…the creative team has been committed to creating a safe, collaborative, and mutually respectful working environment, and last year, the team made creative changes they felt were in the best interest of both the production and the cast and crew.”</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>When he took over, Levinson put his now patented stamp of disorganization on things, with endless script changes and other issues that production members have described as “chaos.” His rewrites have also been described as “rape fantasies” and “torture porn” by those on set, although they were happy to point out that the very worst scenes (including one where <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lily-Rose Depp</a> begs the Weekend’s character to rape her) didn’t end up getting filmed.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=false>As it is, nobody really knows how The Idol will turn out. But one thing is for sure: Sam Levinson, enabled by the Weeknd, has bought into his own hype, even though he’s simply rehashing old, misogynistic, and frankly boring tropes. Great cinematography and acting can turn hacky, cliche writing into something good, as we saw with Euphoria, but it seems like Levinson has pushed it too far this time. Hopefully daddy won’t be able to dig him out of this mess.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9KapGaklau2r7%2FOp6pmm5%2BjwbO71Z6prKGVqHqmxM%2BlmKKmlZl6qrrCpaydoZ6ceqbBz6Gmq6GRYsGmutKipqdlnpq9sHnBmpmyZZSnrq6tjJqlnWWknbJutcOoo2aspae6sLXLaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsam-levinsons-controversies-explained-including-euphoria-tension-nepo-baby-drama-and-the-idol-turmoil.html&text=&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsam-levinsons-controversies-explained-including-euphoria-tension-nepo-baby-drama-and-the-idol-turmoil.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsam-levinsons-controversies-explained-including-euphoria-tension-nepo-baby-drama-and-the-idol-turmoil.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsam-levinsons-controversies-explained-including-euphoria-tension-nepo-baby-drama-and-the-idol-turmoil.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsam-levinsons-controversies-explained-including-euphoria-tension-nepo-baby-drama-and-the-idol-turmoil.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsam-levinsons-controversies-explained-including-euphoria-tension-nepo-baby-drama-and-the-idol-turmoil.html&description=" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./maestro-rem-song-leonard-bernstein.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About The R.E.M.
