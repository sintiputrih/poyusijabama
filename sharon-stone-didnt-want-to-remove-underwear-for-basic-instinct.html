Not on my own with the director … but with a room full of agents and lawyers, most of whom had nothing to do with the project,” Stone, 63, recalled in the excerpt, which was published by <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> on Thursday, March 18.</p><p>“That was how I saw my vagina-shot for the first time, long after I’d been told, ‘We can’t see anything — I just need you to remove your panties, as the white is reflecting the light, so we know you have panties on.’ Yes, there have been many points of view on this topic, but since I’m the one with the vagina in question, let me say: The other points of view are bulls—t.”</p><p>Stone said that after seeing the scene, she slapped director <strong>Paul Verhoeven</strong> across the face and called her lawyer, who told her the 1992 movie would not be able to be released as it was.</p><p>The lawyer also promised the Casino actress that she could fight to have the scene removed. Stone was relieved … at first.</p><p>“Then I thought some more. What if I were the director? What if I had gotten that shot? What if I had gotten it on purpose? Or by accident? What if it just existed? That was a lot to think about,” the Total Recall star wrote.</p><p>After explaining her lawyer’s words to Verhoeven, Stone was told she had no say in the matter after all. The lead disagreed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sharon-Stone-Says-She-Was-Swindled-Into-Removing-Her-Underwear-for-Famous-Basic-Instinct-Scene.jpg><p>“But I did have choices. So I thought and thought and I chose to allow this scene in the film. Why? Because it was correct for the film and for the character; and because, after all, I did it,” the Pennsylvania native wrote.</p><p>In the excerpt, the iconic actress detailed more ways she was let down throughout her career.</p><p>“I had actor approval in my contract. No one cared. They cast who they wanted. To my dismay, sometimes. To the detriment of the picture, sometimes,” she recalled. “I had a producer bring me to his office … he explained to me why I should f—k my costar so that we could have onscreen chemistry.”</p><p>After the producer told Stone that he’d used the same technique early in his career with Ava Gardner, the actress noted that the encounter made her realize just how long women had been dealing with the same sort of situation.</p><p>“Now just the creepy thought of him in the same room with Ava Gardner gave me pause. Then I realized that she also had to put up with him and pretend that he was in any way interesting.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Oscar nominee fought the misogynistic treatment, which caused her to be <a href=#>labeled as “difficult”</a> by her coworkers.</p><p>“I’ve had other producers on other films just come to my trailer and ask, ‘So, are you going to f—k him, or aren’t you? … You know it would go better if you did.’” she wrote. “I take my time and explain that I am like the nice girl they grew up with, and get them to recall that girl’s name. This leaves us all with a little bit of our dignity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqhmaKku26%2F06ilnmWUnrGvwIywmKesXam8br7EpqavnV2qu6Wx0bCcmqpdm7yzecGaqqKbXZ67tMDIp5qtZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsharon-stone-didnt-want-to-remove-underwear-for-basic-instinct.html&text=Sharon%20Stone%20Didn%27t%20Want%20to%20Remove%20Underwear%20for%20%27Basic%20Instinct%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsharon-stone-didnt-want-to-remove-underwear-for-basic-instinct.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsharon-stone-didnt-want-to-remove-underwear-for-basic-instinct.html&title=Sharon%20Stone%20Didn%27t%20Want%20to%20Remove%20Underwear%20for%20%27Basic%20Instinct%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsharon-stone-didnt-want-to-remove-underwear-for-basic-instinct.html&title=Sharon%20Stone%20Didn%27t%20Want%20to%20Remove%20Underwear%20for%20%27Basic%20Instinct%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsharon-stone-didnt-want-to-remove-underwear-for-basic-instinct.html&title=Sharon%20Stone%20Didn%27t%20Want%20to%20Remove%20Underwear%20for%20%27Basic%20Instinct%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsharon-stone-didnt-want-to-remove-underwear-for-basic-instinct.html&description=Sharon%20Stone%20Didn%27t%20Want%20to%20Remove%20Underwear%20for%20%27Basic%20Instinct%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./best-twitter-reactions-met-gala-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 26 Best Twitter Reactions to the 2024 Met Gala">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./denis-mukwege-wikipedia-biography-wife-age-nationality-nobel-peace-prize.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Denis Mukwege Wikipedia, Biography, Wife, Age, Nationality, Nobel Peace Prize">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
